      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Some links on this site earn me a commission if you buy through them. I only link to products I personally own and use. Commissions never influence my reviews — I've published plenty of critical content about products I have referral links for.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">FTC Disclosure</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          In accordance with the FTC's guidelines, TobyOnFitnessTech discloses that some links on this website are affiliate or referral links. If you click these links and make a qualifying purchase, I may receive compensation at no additional cost to you.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Speediance</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I have a referral relationship with Speediance. I own two Speediance machines (the original Gym Monster and the Gym Monster 2S) and have lifted over 1.2 million pounds on them. My referral link lets you purchase at the standard price while supporting this channel.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          My affiliate relationship has not prevented me from publishing critical reviews of Speediance software, including detailed coverage of bugs, firmware regressions, and features I believe should have been implemented differently. If you've watched my content, you know I call it as I see it.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Amazon</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          This site participates in the Amazon Associates Program. Links to products on Amazon may be affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Other Products</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          When referral or affiliate programs are available for products I review (WHOOP, Garmin, etc.), I may use them. Any such relationship is covered by this disclosure. Products mentioned without affiliate links are mentioned purely on editorial merit.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Affiliate relationships do not influence editorial content. I have received no free products or payments in exchange for positive coverage. All products reviewed were purchased with my own money unless explicitly stated otherwise.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          If that ever changes, it will be disclosed clearly in the relevant content.
