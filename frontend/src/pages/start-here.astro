        In 2023, I weighed 242 lbs. I was obese, approaching 40, and done making excuses. Six months later I was at 188 lbs. Here's exactly how — and why I built a channel around it.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">The Turnaround</h2>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        In early 2023, I had a moment of clarity that a lot of people who've struggled with weight will recognize: I stepped on a scale, saw a number I couldn't rationalize away, and made a decision.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        I didn't join a gym. I bought a Tonal — a smart strength training machine — and designed a workout program based on the Arnold Schwarzenegger Blueprint: Push, Pull, Legs, repeated twice a week with a running day in between. Six days of training, one day off. For six months, I didn't miss a session.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        The data was everything. I tracked every pound lifted on Tonal. I wore a WHOOP for recovery. I logged every meal in Cronometer. I ran 4-mile routes and tracked pace on Garmin. When the numbers told me to rest, I rested. When they said I could push, I pushed.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        At the end of those six months: 242 → 188 lbs. And a very specific opinion about which fitness technology actually works and which is marketing noise.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12">Why I Started This Channel</h2>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        When I switched from Tonal to Speediance, I couldn't find honest, technical reviews from someone who actually lifts heavy. Most reviews are by beginners or journalists. I needed reviews from someone who's been in a cut, who understands progressive overload, who cares about how the motor behaves under real load.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        So I made those reviews myself. I now own two Speediance machines. I've lifted over 1.2 million pounds on them. I've documented every firmware update, every bug, every improvement. If you're serious about home gym tech, this is the most detailed independent coverage you'll find.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        I also train BJJ and I'm building toward a 4-mile race time goal in 2026. The channel covers all of it — because the data, the technology, and the mindset all connect.
