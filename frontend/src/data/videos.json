      "description": "Speediance V3.1 is here on my upstairs 2S, and after a few days of real workouts with the new firmware, I\u2019m convinced \u201cSafety Start\u201d is not the safety feature it\u2019s advertised to be.  In this video I walk through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the V3.1 software and firmware combo, including slower cable retraction, unsafe slack behavior, and a massive downgrade to partner and dual\u2011load modes compared to the old software.\nWe\u2019ll test Safety Start in free lift, barbell, and handle movements, and I\u2019ll show why it was clearly built to support upcoming Pilates features rather than to actually fix the real safety problems lifters were seeing.  I also demo how the new firmware makes retraction noticeably worse than on my original Speediance downstairs, why dual\u2011load mode is more broken than ever, and how bringing back partner lifting without independent sides or a true guest profile is a step backward, not an upgrade.\nIf you own a Speediance 2S or original Gym Monster and you\u2019re wondering whether to update, how to stay safe with heavy eccentric work, and whether Safety Start should be part of your normal setup, this breakdown is for you.  I\u2019ll also cover how I actually lift (warm\u2011ups, one\u2011second pause vs relying on software \u201csafety,\u201d and why I\u2019d rather risk the machine than my spine) so you can decide what makes sense in your own home gym.\nTimestamps (edit to taste):\n \u2022 00:00 Intro \u2013 Speediance 2S vs original and V3.1 context\n \u2022 03:10 New firmware, retraction changes, and why it feels worse\n \u2022 08:25 Safety Start demo in free lift (and why I almost never use it)\n \u2022 15:40 Dual\u2011load & partner mode: from real safety feature to downgrade\n \u2022 24:10 Guest profiles, missing second user support, and UI gaps\n \u2022 32:00 When Safety Start \u201chelps\u201d vs when it hurts your range of motion\n \u2022 40:15 My real\u2011world lifting workflow and safety priorities\nIf you like deep\u2011dive Speediance testing, honest firmware reviews, and real training use cases (not just promo clips), hit like, subscribe, and drop your questions in the comments so I can test them in future videos.\nSuggested tags/keywords (copy/paste + tweak):\nspeediance v3.1, speediance 2s, speediance firmware, speediance safety start, speediance retraction issue, speediance partner mode, speediance dual load, speediance review, smart home gym, digital weight, tonal vs speediance, fitness tech, toby on fitness tech",

I\u2019ll also explain who the Speediance is not for\u2014especially if your spouse wants a fully coached, English\u2011speaking female trainer experience\u2014and why, even after 10M lbs on Tonal and over 1M lbs on Speediance, I still consider this hardware an upgrade.\nWe\u2019ll talk about why I mute coach audio and only use system sounds, how I set up eccentric\u2011focused custom workouts, and why bringing the handles back under load to the rubber stoppers is one of my favorite advantages over Tonal\u2019s plastic\u2011on\u2011plastic design. I also dig into Speediance\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d and Workout Plus marketing, why you still can\u2019t truly do custom partner/family workouts together, and what a good partner mode implementation should actually look like in Free Lift and Wellness/Workout Plus.\nIf you\u2019re debating Tonal vs Speediance, wondering what V3 really changes, or trying to decide whether this smart gym will work for you and your partner, this video should give you a real\u2011world, heavy\u2011use perspective instead of just brochure specs.\nTimestamps (adjust as needed):\n0:00 Intro \u2013 V3 software and who Speediance is NOT for\n2:10 Female coach situation (English vs Spanish) and guided workouts\n5:25 Why Speediance was an upgrade over Tonal for me\n8:40 V3 UX changes, sliders, and nagware they finally removed\n13:05 Free Lift partner mode: what we lost in V3\n18:30 Safety Start, firmware issues on the 2S, and my lifting style\n24:10 Hardware limitations, Tonal 2 parallels, and new features only on newer units\n29:00 \u201cFamily\u201d / Workout Plus plan and why it still isn\u2019t real family training\n34:00 What I want from partner mode and final thoughts on V3\nIf you like deep\u2011dive smart gym content, honest UX breakdowns, and real training talk (not just promo reels), hit like, drop your questions in the comments, and subscribe so you don\u2019t miss future Speediance and Tonal updates.",

This is the version they used in the early Speediance demos, and it shows off something Tonal simply can\u2019t do: two independent motors letting two people lift different weights, at the same time, on the same machine.\nWe walk through how this older partner mode works inside Free Lift, why it never really tracked guests properly, how the Bluetooth handles behave, and why it ends up feeling more like a \u201cfun functional trainer\u201d than a serious progressive-overload tool. You\u2019ll see Lily and me lifting side\u2011by\u2011side with separate resistance, comparing rep counts, watching the dual power graphs (green vs yellow lines), and even testing assist modes that auto\u2011drop the weight mid\u2011rep.\nI also break down the tradeoffs between V2 and V3: what\u2019s actually been removed, what\u2019s still in the newer software (like the redesigned Free Lift screen and dynamic modes), and why the community expects some version of this \u201ctrue\u201d partner mode to return in a future update. If you own a Speediance or you\u2019re comparing it to Tonal, this is a great real\u2011world look at how dual\u2011motor design changes what\u2019s possible for family training and kid\u2011friendly workouts.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro & why this feature vanished in V3\n1:10 V2 vs V3 partner modes explained\n3:45 Free Lift partner mode demo with Lily\n8:20 Why Tonal can\u2019t do this style of partner lifting\n12:05 Assist modes, safety, and kids on digital weight\n16:30 Why I still don\u2019t program real workouts in this mode\n\nIf you like seeing real\u2011world Speediance testing, father\u2011daughter workouts, and honest smart\u2011gym breakdowns, make sure to like and subscribe so we can keep experimenting with features before they disappear.",

      "description": "Viewers are often told to trust their wearable data implicitly, but this footage throws a serious wrench in that assumption. Witness the moment a demanding strength session drives the Garmin Body Battery down to an almost unheard-of 5%. It\u2019s a stark illustration of how intensely a workout impacts the body's readiness score\u2014far beyond just logging time. This challenges the simple training talk, hinting at a deeper connection between programmed intensity (like the Arnold Blueprint methods used during a massive deficit) and the device's assessment of true fatigue. The big question remains: is the device accurately capturing the overload, or is this just a system glitch? The full analysis reveals what this recovery metric *really* means for tracking intense training periods.\n#fitness #tracker #accuracy #body #battery #recovery #tracking #strength #training #results #workout #intensity #garmin #insights #fitness #tech #explained #training #splits #secrets",

The footage captures the split second where an overloaded barbell was dropped, bending dangerously close to snapping\u2014a horrifying testament to what can happen when training heavy alone. Listen to the chilling aftermath of this near-disaster, which underscores the absolute necessity of respecting free weight mechanics, especially when recovery is on the line.
