      "description": "Speediance V3.1 is here on my upstairs 2S, and after a few days of real workouts with the new firmware, I’m convinced “Safety Start” is not the safety feature it’s advertised to be.  In this video I walk through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the V3.1 software and firmware combo, including slower cable retraction, unsafe slack behavior, and a massive downgrade to partner and dual‑load modes compared to the old software.\nWe’ll test Safety Start in free lift, barbell, and handle movements, and I’ll show why it was clearly built to support upcoming Pilates features rather than to actually fix the real safety problems lifters were seeing.  I also demo how the new firmware makes retraction noticeably worse than on my original Speediance downstairs, why dual‑load mode is more broken than ever, and how bringing back partner lifting without independent sides or a true guest profile is a step backward, not an upgrade.\nIf you own a Speediance 2S or original Gym Monster and you’re wondering whether to update, how to stay safe with heavy eccentric work, and whether Safety Start should be part of your normal setup, this breakdown is for you.  I’ll also cover how I actually lift (warm‑ups, one‑second pause vs relying on software “safety,” and why I’d rather risk the machine than my spine) so you can decide what makes sense in your own home gym.\nTimestamps (edit to taste):\n • 00:00 Intro – Speediance 2S vs original and V3.1 context\n • 03:10 New firmware, retraction changes, and why it feels worse\n • 08:25 Safety Start demo in free lift (and why I almost never use it)\n • 15:40 Dual‑load & partner mode: from real safety feature to downgrade\n • 24:10 Guest profiles, missing second user support, and UI gaps\n • 32:00 When Safety Start “helps” vs when it hurts your range of motion\n • 40:15 My real‑world lifting workflow and safety priorities\nIf you like deep‑dive Speediance testing, honest firmware reviews, and real training use cases (not just promo clips), hit like, subscribe, and drop your questions in the comments so I can test them in future videos.\nSuggested tags/keywords (copy/paste + tweak):\nspeediance v3.1, speediance 2s, speediance firmware, speediance safety start, speediance retraction issue, speediance partner mode, speediance dual load, speediance review, smart home gym, digital weight, tonal vs speediance, fitness tech, toby on fitness tech",

I’ll also explain who the Speediance is not for—especially if your spouse wants a fully coached, English‑speaking female trainer experience—and why, even after 10M lbs on Tonal and over 1M lbs on Speediance, I still consider this hardware an upgrade.\nWe’ll talk about why I mute coach audio and only use system sounds, how I set up eccentric‑focused custom workouts, and why bringing the handles back under load to the rubber stoppers is one of my favorite advantages over Tonal’s plastic‑on‑plastic design. I also dig into Speediance’s “family” and Workout Plus marketing, why you still can’t truly do custom partner/family workouts together, and what a good partner mode implementation should actually look like in Free Lift and Wellness/Workout Plus.\nIf you’re debating Tonal vs Speediance, wondering what V3 really changes, or trying to decide whether this smart gym will work for you and your partner, this video should give you a real‑world, heavy‑use perspective instead of just brochure specs.\nTimestamps (adjust as needed):\n0:00 Intro – V3 software and who Speediance is NOT for\n2:10 Female coach situation (English vs Spanish) and guided workouts\n5:25 Why Speediance was an upgrade over Tonal for me\n8:40 V3 UX changes, sliders, and nagware they finally removed\n13:05 Free Lift partner mode: what we lost in V3\n18:30 Safety Start, firmware issues on the 2S, and my lifting style\n24:10 Hardware limitations, Tonal 2 parallels, and new features only on newer units\n29:00 “Family” / Workout Plus plan and why it still isn’t real family training\n34:00 What I want from partner mode and final thoughts on V3\nIf you like deep‑dive smart gym content, honest UX breakdowns, and real training talk (not just promo reels), hit like, drop your questions in the comments, and subscribe so you don’t miss future Speediance and Tonal updates.",

This is the version they used in the early Speediance demos, and it shows off something Tonal simply can’t do: two independent motors letting two people lift different weights, at the same time, on the same machine.\nWe walk through how this older partner mode works inside Free Lift, why it never really tracked guests properly, how the Bluetooth handles behave, and why it ends up feeling more like a “fun functional trainer” than a serious progressive-overload tool. You’ll see Lily and me lifting side‑by‑side with separate resistance, comparing rep counts, watching the dual power graphs (green vs yellow lines), and even testing assist modes that auto‑drop the weight mid‑rep.\nI also break down the tradeoffs between V2 and V3: what’s actually been removed, what’s still in the newer software (like the redesigned Free Lift screen and dynamic modes), and why the community expects some version of this “true” partner mode to return in a future update. If you own a Speediance or you’re comparing it to Tonal, this is a great real‑world look at how dual‑motor design changes what’s possible for family training and kid‑friendly workouts.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro & why this feature vanished in V3\n1:10 V2 vs V3 partner modes explained\n3:45 Free Lift partner mode demo with Lily\n8:20 Why Tonal can’t do this style of partner lifting\n12:05 Assist modes, safety, and kids on digital weight\n16:30 Why I still don’t program real workouts in this mode\n\nIf you like seeing real‑world Speediance testing, father‑daughter workouts, and honest smart‑gym breakdowns, make sure to like and subscribe so we can keep experimenting with features before they disappear.",

      "description": "Viewers are often told to trust their wearable data implicitly, but this footage throws a serious wrench in that assumption. Witness the moment a demanding strength session drives the Garmin Body Battery down to an almost unheard-of 5%. It’s a stark illustration of how intensely a workout impacts the body's readiness score—far beyond just logging time. This challenges the simple training talk, hinting at a deeper connection between programmed intensity (like the Arnold Blueprint methods used during a massive deficit) and the device's assessment of true fatigue. The big question remains: is the device accurately capturing the overload, or is this just a system glitch? The full analysis reveals what this recovery metric *really* means for tracking intense training periods.\n#fitness #tracker #accuracy #body #battery #recovery #tracking #strength #training #results #workout #intensity #garmin #insights #fitness #tech #explained #training #splits #secrets",
