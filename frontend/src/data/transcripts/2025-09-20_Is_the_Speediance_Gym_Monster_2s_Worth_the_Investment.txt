It's like, should I buy the original Speedance at, you know, right now it's on sale for like $2,400 and it ranges between $2,400 and 2,600. It it's never it's never the full price anymore. Um, or you're paying almost double for this device. And I actually do think the double the money is worth it. Surprisingly, I really thought when this thing was sitting on the other side of my property, I'm like, I'm going to get this thing into the house. It's going to be loud. It's not going to feel heavy. It's just going to get returned.
