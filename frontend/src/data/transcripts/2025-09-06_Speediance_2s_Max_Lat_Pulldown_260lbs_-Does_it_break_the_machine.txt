to fitness tech. So, I was browsing the speeds community, the Facebook group in particular, and I saw someone post something that was really interesting. Basically, they had posted that they were trying to do lat pull downs on this machine, well, on the original Gym Monster, and it felt kind of wobbly. And that got my kind of brain turning a little bit to actually shoot a video because this is the 2S capable of 260 lbs. And I never even thought to try to do a lap down at the full weight. I can tell you at 185 lb, uh, I was able to have the tonal pull me up because it's capable of 200 lb of resistance. Um, this machine because of the angles is probably not going to pull me up even at the 260 Well, it would pull me up. It would for sure not allow me to pull it down. And that's what I'm going to get into next. So, first I'm going to turn on the machine. And then I'm going to bring these up to L0, right? Because that's the first part of our lap pull down. Then also the other thing that I immediately thought is, oh, he probably doesn't have these locked in correctly. So, this has little locks. And when I first got the machine, I didn't realize that these have to be very specifically centered and then locked down. I mean, it makes sense, but I didn't realize it. So, I had them locked down with it at the edge like this. And that doesn't actually do anything. So, it was very, very wobbly when I got the original Gym Monster until I realized these have to actually be locked in the center. And then it locks down. The other thing is this is now on carpet up in my office. So on carpet, it was a little wobbly for the first week when I moved it from the living room to the office. And that's just because it's sitting carpet. So if your surface area is carpet, it's going to be more wobbly than if your surface area was uh you know like tile or concrete, something like that. So just realize that those also play a factor in it. But in general, I've never even thought to try to lift the max weight. Nor would I. And luckily, I'm within my 30-day return policy. So, if this destroys the machine, uh, you know, at least I can send it back to them, right? Because I am not guaranteeing that the machine can actually do that, uh, and I'm interested in trying. So, first steps first. If you're going to do something like this where you're lifting heavy, I'm actually going to put a rash guard on, and you'll see why in a second. um when when you're lifting. So, if you're lifting anything that's above your natural weight or if you're pulling out from the machine and you're light and this is something I experienced when I was 185 lbs. Right now, I'm walking around at 200 lb. So, I don't quite have that problem or have as much of that problem and I'm not pulling quite as much weight as I was at 185. I was really focused on a strength phase at that lower weight. And so when I was doing that, the solution to this or the best solution to this in my opinion is a weighted vest. So what we're going to do is we put this weighted vest on, right? And then I put the weights in the front of the vest. I put all the weights on the back of the vest already. I'm going to need the maximum amount of weight that this thing can do because 260 lb will pull me around. So, at 200 lb, I actually need more weight. And so, what I'm doing is I'm sliding the weights into this weighted vest. And we'll get started once I get all the weights in the front of the vest. I preloaded the back of the vest weights. Um, but it gets pretty heavy to try to preload the front of the weight uh the front weights before you put the the thing on. It's just easier to put it on first, then load the front weights if you're going to load the maximum amount in one of these things. I do have a a heavier weighted vest than this one. So, I'm hoping this one's heavy enough because I'd have to find the heavier one and finding that is obviously a struggle. I assume I moved it to my basement for whatever reason. Probably to walk on the treadmill down there with a bleed vest. That is actually a really good way to get additional cardio in. Instead of upping your upping your stride to a jog, adding a weighted vest to simulate your original weight. So when I was coming down in weight, I would add back any pounds I lost. So realize part of the thing that caused me to lose so much weight so rapidly is I was coming down in weight and then I was adding all that weight back with a weighted vest. So I was coming down from 250 pounds. As I got down to 200 pounds, I was still using the weighted vest for some of my walking. I couldn't use it on all my walking because it's actually pretty fatiguing. So, this is actually a huge benefit to be able to use something like this in that context. Okay. So, I actually had it for that. And then I realized once I got down to 185 pounds, I needed it for uh for lifting, too. So, what we're going to do here is we go here. And these are the smart handles, by the way. Uh someone had asked some questions on whether the smart handles are worth it. And if the smart handles are worth it, is there any hiccups? And one of them is, you notice I turned the smart handles on before I went into my free lift. It's easier if the smart handles are on and connected before you start the workout. Otherwise, you're kind of waiting on them to connect to be able to turn on the weight. So, I'm just going to go into free lift here and I'm going to crank the weight up to the the whole thing. Now, realize I have never ever attempted to do this. So, I have it at 130 lbs per side, which would be 260 lbs total. Make sure you can see that. You may not be able to see the clearest in here, but you'll be able to see me attempt this at least. I have no idea if I'm actually capable of doing that. So, we're going to see A, is the machine wobbly whenever I go to do this. B, can I actually pull that weight down? See if I can. We'll have to dial it back a little bit. But, this thing is on me so that I can actually uh even attempt this because otherwise I'm pretty sure it'll pull me up. So, let's give this a shot here. [Music] Yeah. The answer to that is I need more weight. So, I'm going to have to go back, find my other weighted vest. This was not heavy enough. You could see I could get the cables to come halfway down with all of my weight coming up and going the whole way against the wall. What I was actually shocked about though, by the way, not wobbly in any respect. There was no wobble, no give to this device. That is a lot of weight. So, I'm going to have to find my 80 lb weighted vest and reattempt this with a bigger vest or with both vests on because that only went halfway down and it pulled me up. That is a lot of weight. I can tell you that. Uh to be able to one, I didn't know that this machine would actually be able to pull me up. And the answer is yes, it can at that weight. I mean, you can see if I turn this on. By the way, I don't recommend doing this, and I'm only willing to do it because, you know, within the 30 days. So, if I turn this thing on, right? And I hold on, and I pull up. Look at this. I can actually do pull-ups on this thing, right? My knees are touching the wall. The wall's not holding any of my weight. This is literally not moving the machine at all. Like, this machine is not budging. And I am budging. I'm literally doing pull-ups on the thing. If it was a little higher, you can see the pull-ups a little better, but my knees are coming up here against the wall and sliding up and down. I mean, anyone who questions whether this is 260 lb. There's no question. At 200 lb, I don't even move these. At uh let me actually measure real quick. So, give me one second. I'll grab my scale. throw my scale on here and see what I weigh with the weighted vest. So, by the way, everyone wonders what scale I use or know anyone who would wonder. Really, really cheap Amazon scale. So, this is the scale I use. Um, I've been using it every day for four years or something like that. connects into my phone, Bluetooth to my phone. I have a almost $1,000 Tanata scale. And this thing is what I use. Why? Super simple. Connects into my phone, gives me a reading every day. Charts it into Whoop and into Apple Health and everything else so I can see where I'm at weight. I also have a little app that has its own algorithm to tell me, am I losing or am I gaining? Am I losing or gaining at an appropriate rate? uh so that I'm not losing muscle mass or gaining a whole bunch of fat mass. So, we'll weigh ourselves right now. Let me let me let it calibrate real quick. Calibrating. That's not going to be right. Okay. Got to do it off off the speed apparently. That's even more. Let me do it real quickly over here. Okay. Yeah, like two 202 203. Let me grab this thing and see what this weighs. So, I have to do it on a hard surface. So, I'm going to grab that. Go over here. Boom. So, 242 lbs is what I weigh with this thing. So, I'm look I'm about 240 243 lb. This thing's set to 260 total. So, it's 130% 260. And the question of whether it's a 260 is yeah, I mean, I could barely get these things to budge. And that's pulling down as hard as I can while kind of having the knees on the wall to get a little bit of leverage with that on. And with it not on, the machine just pulls me up. I don't even It doesn't even budge the cords, which is pretty wild. I'll have a I'll be right back with the heavier weighted vest. Okay, I'm back. So now I have my second weighted vest. So let's try this again. So first I'm going to turn on the machine. Make sure my handles are turned on. While those are turning on, I'm going to put on weighted vest number one. This time at its full weight. So I'm just throwing it on at its full weight. That puts me up at 243 pounds. So, I'm now sitting at 243 lbs. That wasn't enough weight last time. What's funny is I'm not disappointed in the machine, but I'm definitely disappointed that I wasn't able to pull that down. And I think it was weight related. So, let's grab the second weighted vest. Throw that on. By the way, I don't recommend doing this, wearing two weighted vests and applying a whole bunch of weight to the weighted vest. This is uh strictly forformational purposes only. And I can tell you this this isn't enough weight. I don't know what would be. So, we're going to go here. Throw all this weight in here. Shove the weight in there. Okay, have it close enough. Not the prettiest thing in the world, but it is heavy. This should be enough weight to at least hold me down. So, we're here. Sit back. Turn on the weight. Have it go the whole way up. That's a full weight. I'll count it as a rep and I'm going to count it as a rep. I can tell you I could only get this down to about my shoulders and it is heavy. This is extremely heavy. So, I did count that as a rep. Technically, I counted two reps, but the first one I was about right here. The second one I did get the whole way down and hurt the ding. Um, the answer is yes. If you have enough weight on your body, this thing will actually And by the way, there's no wobble. So, for that person who said it had wobble, I don't know if that's one of the improvements with the 2S, but that thing didn't shake at all. My muscles were completely shaking though. So that is impressive. I mean, that gives you an idea of what this machine's capable of, you know, and I've gotten a lot stronger in four years to be able to even pull that. But you can see how complicated it was for me to get to be able to pull. I had to put on two weighted vests. That's probably an extra 100 pounds of weight on me. So, I had to get my weight up to nearly 300 lb to be able to try to pull these things down. What blows my mind is there's no give in the cables. There was no wobbliness in the machine. I'm just blown away. I was fully expecting this thing to wobble like heck, you know? I I was I was expecting a lot of wobble and a lot of give. When the machine pulled me up at 200 lb, I could feel there's no give. Uh, it's like having a squad back in terms of its abilities. Now, I don't know if that's specific to the 2s. Um, that's where, you know, fire beware. I can run the same test on the one downstairs if people want to see it. If someone wants to see that test at 220 downstairs, put a comment down below and I will re-shoot a video with it on the 220 lb. I can tell you I don't want to do that a lot because that is a lot of weight and my muscles are trashed just from attempting that. I didn't even do any lifting yet today. In terms of my experiences with the 2S so far, I've had it for a week. I converted over one of my full tonal workouts onto the speeds. Uh I'm absolutely loving it so far. Uh, I will tell you one other video that I saw online where someone was posting that they they um they were looking at the the speedians and it wasn't showing them their their maxes and they didn't do the strength assessment and then they were also going in and hand entering their weights. So, both of those are not going to give you. So, if we go in here, are you sure you want to exit? Okay. Right. So, if we go in here and we go into one of my custom workouts, and this is one of them that I I brought over. It's called Warrior One. I don't know why I named it that, but that is what I named it. There was a reason at the time two years ago, and I can't remember. And this is one of my workouts from there. And you can see all of this is set to weights chose by the machine. And the one problem is if you don't do the strength assessment, it's going to set those to a very, very low weight. Uh my problem was the opposite. Set it to very very high weights because I do centric mode. Uh and I had to actually back off the weights a little bit and then it recalculated everything. and that it's been working phenomenally. Uh the one the one other gotcha that I will explain while I'm shooting video anyways is I found out that I would have expected from me and like my goals that gain muscle would be my preset training and that's that's what I was expecting it to be because strength put you in a low rep range and gain muscle put you in the rep range that I normally operate at. No, for me to to get these entered in quickly and to have a consistent uh number of reps, I actually picked stamina. And the reason because if I go stamina 2013, like I was surmising in my last video, and I was speculating that this would work for warm-up sets. Sure enough, it does work. It is absolutely phenomenal for workout for for for warm-ups. So, I'm setting it to 20 with a rep of 13 reps. But then when I do my actual sets, I actually, if I scroll down here, what you will see is my actual working sets are set to 15 and 13. So what I end up doing is I'm setting it to the minimum of of which is 15 reps for for for hitting the 1 RM and then 13 is the value. Meaning if I hit 16 reps, I'm going to hit a new 1 RM. in general. There's a few caveats there and I saw other things uh where people have and I have this experience too now because when I first set up this uh program, I didn't realize that you have to do right and left separately and you have to make sure you leave both right and left on. If you just create one set, it doesn't give you a right. So, it only has you do one arm and then if you choose to do both arms on the one arm, you could do that. You can just skip backwards and do the other arm. The speed knows you're doing the other arm, but it doesn't automatically insert a new record. So, I thought I was doing 26 reps on one arm and then up my one RM. Thankfully, I have the setting turned on. And everyone should have this setting. This is another one of those settings where everyone should have this setting turned on. It shouldn't even be like it shouldn't even be a question of whether or not you have this setting turned on. But, if I go into training preferences and here it is. RM setting. The one at the very bottom, the other one where instead of putting a question mark info button, they put a long uh set of text underneath it, it's one RM setting and when performing unilateral row exercises such as bend over single one row, is it necessary to record the one RM for each separately? The answer is both sides jointly use the latest one RM right this is the way to go for this. Um I the other option the other option I don't think you should ever use I don't I don't from a because what the other option is going to do is it's going to load each of them separately and give you different one arm values and then give you different values of the left side and the right side when you're actually working out. You want it to be actually set to the lower of the two and I believe that's actually what it's doing from what I could tell. because I wasn't hitting new 1RM um because it was setting the 1RM value to the to it seemed like to the to the lower or the latest which would be the lower of the two sides. Um that was my guess, but maybe that's the wording is not quite correct with what they're actually doing on it because I wasn't hitting new I was doing 16 reps and I was not hitting a new 1 RM and my theory theory is because it's actually picking the 1 RM from the lesser of the two sides and not the stronger of the two sides which this would indicate stronger of two sides but I believe it's actually lesser and lesser of two sides is way safer so in terms of safety like it should be picking the lesser of the two sides and then giving you the one RM of that side and then using that in the calculation to give you both weights for both sides which is what it's doing under the hood like it's giving you both of the same weight this setting is a very important setting But yeah, this machine I am blown away. That didn't budge at all. And this is on carpet. Like this machine didn't budge at all. Went on carpet at 260 lbs. Even the tonal feels sketchy. When you're pulling on the machine, it feels like those arms are going to snap. This I didn't feel anything. And what blew my mind, I'll show you one more time without the because it just blows my mind. So, one more time at 130 lbs. Let me see if I can do it this way. Uh, I want to hit my screen. I don't know how to do it without hitting my screen. If I try to do it this way, because I'm going to be too close to the screen. I need my head to be further away from the screen. It's going to put my head into the screen. So, I have to hit it with my back to the camera. But this just blows my mind. So if I'm down here, right, turn the turn the weight on, right? Try to hold it as long as I can. There I go. I go for a ride. Literally, I'm going for a ride up my wall. That's That's just awesome. I mean, that and I'm I'm 200 lb right now. I'm 20 I'm almost 205 after eating breakfast. Like unbelievable that this thing just pulled me up the wall. I didn't think it would do that. You know, I knew the tonal could do it at 185 lb. And at at 200 lb, the tonal didn't do that. So, at 200 lb, the the tonal would lift me up an inch or so and then drop me back down. Like, it couldn't pick me the whole way up. This thing is just picking me up like I'm a baby. Let me show you one more time because it's just so freaking cool. And, you know, it's still in the warranty window and it looks like it's not going to break it at all. Looks like it's actually designed to do this, which blows my mind. So, I'm down here. I've got this thing down here. I've got my arms locked in as best as I can. I turn the weight on, holding as tight as I can. Up. I go the whole wall. And you can hear me hit the wall. Feel the dents on my wall. Oh, I can always repaint that. This is chalkboard behind me. So, so I can start writing on the wall if I need to write anything. Uh, but yeah, that was my video for today. That's probably the most fun I've had on the machine so far, to be honest with you. Uh, I was not expecting that result. I was really expecting this thing to wobble. Like, I was expecting it to like, you see how I can make it shake? It doesn't shake at all whenever whenever my full weights on it. I can only make it shake by pushing it, you know, and pushing it specifically from here. If I try to push it from here, you can see because it's on carpet, I can get it to move a little bit. When it's downstairs on the tile, I can't even get it to move. But this is so cool. I mean, I I sound like a a shill for the thing, but honestly, I was not expecting that from this. Whenever I saw the person say that it shakes and wobbles, I was expecting a lot of wobble. And I was sure not expecting it to just yank me off the ground, you know, because I could I forget that I can hold my own weight. The reason why it's yanking me off the ground like that is I can hold my own weight and lock my arms in here and not have them bend as as it's pulling up on me. So, it's just yanking me up uh with with ease. Like it doesn't even look the the fans not kicking on. There's no struggle. this machine like this hono when I had that thing at max weight those fans kicked on and it sounded like a jet airplane taking off which like no criticism I you know I I have you know I had this weighted vest on so I had this weighted vest on at full weight so I have this thing on at full weight and you know what I mean it's it's sounding like a jet that engine as I'm trying to pull down. And you know, after I do like one or two reps, it's starting to, you know, really scream at me. And no fault to the tonal, I was just impressed the machine could do that, you know, with something that's bolted to your wall. Uh, but yeah, the fans would kick on like crazy. This thing doesn't even seem like doesn't even seem like it was drying. Anyways, thank you for your time today. Uh, like and subscribe if you have any other questions. If you want to see a video of me attempting the same thing on the original Gym Monster that's downstairs, I can do that for you. If you have anything else you want to see me do on the machine, it is ridiculous. Have me do it now while I'm still in the 30-day warranty period. But I can tell you if it handled that as effortlessly it just did. I have a feeling there's nothing you could ask me to do on this thing that would really break it. Um, anything that I'm capable of doing, of course. you know, I'm not going to be able to do, you know, uh, bicep curls at the full weight, right? Like, I'm not that strong, but anything I can do, uh, cuz deadlifts, I already did it the full weight. And it also seemed effortless for the machine, way more effortful for me than the machine. And that, uh, you know, this I cannot believe with the cables up this high that those cables don't wobble. Absolutely no wobble in the machine at
