Hello and welcome to Toby on Fitness Tech. This will be a little bit different than most of the videos that I've been making. Usually most of my videos are made here on the speeds and uh and uh I'm describing features of Speedians and I'll get back to that. I have a couple more things to go over now that I've been using the machines a lot more, the one downstairs plus the one up here. Uh just a few more feedback items and a few more pieces of information that I found out along the way. But I wanted to make a video because early on I got a YouTube comment that was both hugely flattering and uh also a little concerning from a standpoint of goals perspective. So what I wanted to talk about you talk talk to you about specifically was how I lost the weight with this transformation. That's why I have my notes here so that I get all the dates right because basically I went from 242 lbs to 188 lbs in the course of roughly a six-month time frame. But in doing that, uh, that of course set up the, and that was in 2023, that set up the physique that I have today. So, uh, the comment in particular that I had gotten was, hey, I'm going to buy the original Speedance and then when I get a physique that looks like yours, I'm going to buy the the Gym Monster 2. And that inspired me to shoot this video talking about how I dropped all of that weight because that 242 lbs. And I'll put the picture down below now so that you can see it. So, that picture of me at 242 lbs, obviously, I didn't look the way I do today. In fact, the first time I put that picture in one of my videos, the guys from Jiu-Jitsu were commenting saying, "Wow, we forgot what you look like back in 2023." Uh, and and I looked like that for a while. Um, you know, slowly ramping up to finally getting sick enough about it to to do something about it in 2023. But I wanted to talk about specifically what I did to make this transformation happen. And in fact, this was the third of these style of transformations that I've done. Uh I was a morbidly obese kid. So I was very fat. I was very skinny whenever I was in elementary school and then I became very fat towards the the end of elementary school and then all throughout high school until my senior year. And what I didn't realize until I was talking to my wife was I had actually never done a transformation naturally. And what do I mean by that? Well, even in high school whenever I went to transform my body from being a fat kid to a relatively fit kid uh my senior year, I actually used a now prescription drug called fentramine. And at the time it was over the counter and I just ordered it off the internet, got it in and boom, it helped me drop the weight. So I get tremendous hunger signaling like the kind of hunger signaling that you would never imagine. And so I one don't get full and two uh have an insatiable appetite. So the more I work out the more hungry I become. And what I didn't realize is I've always used fentramine on all of these weight loss journeys up until this one. So realize all of these weight loss journeys were using a drug. In fact, the last one that I did prior to 2023 was in like, you know, it was like four or five years earlier. And I swear I'd never gained the weight back post that weight loss journey. And that was of course using fentramine and running. And I attributed all of the weight loss to the running and not to the fentramine. So, back uh back in 2023 in particular, I was 242 lbs in June. And then I tried to do the running and all of that kind of stuff. And I had actually been trying to do it all year up until that and failing. So, I'd go out running, I'd get sick, I'd go out running, and you know what I mean? I just would eat more than that and I'd end up gaining weight. So uh in July I'd failed to lose more than 5 pounds total which for someone like me who with the fentramine oh and that was another key factor this weight loss I could not use fentramine right so I had a health condition uh during the flu I guess we'll call it right because you're not allowed to say the words on YouTube also note none of this is medical advice uh I'm not a doctor when I got fentramine for the last weight loss boss. I did it through a doctor. All of this was done through doctors and I'll put links below to the doctors in particular that I used. They may not be the best ones. I'm not saying I don't have any affiliation with them. In fact, I'm not going to put affiliate links below. I'm going to put regular links below because I don't want to I don't want to persuade anyone to do what I did. I'm just going to tell you what I did. And the reason why I'm going to do that is because commented, someone commented that they wanted my physique. And it's like I don't know if you really want to get that physique and do everything I did to make that happen. And so I wanted to be very specific to here's what I did, here's the protocol that I used and be transparent about it. That way there's no ambiguity of, okay, he has six-pack abs. He's, you know, pushing 200 lb now, a little bit over 200 lb, but over 200 lb at this point in time with six-pack abs, you know, at six foot tall and and what I did to make that happen. Um, so yeah, so, uh, July I couldn't lose the weight. I was still at 237 pounds, right? In August is when I got with a new doctor and we changed everything in my protocol. One thing is I've been on TRT for many years, right? So, I had low testosterone many years ago and in fact my before photo that I show you down below shows that you can get fat on TRT. Like it's not impossible, especially when your protocol is suboptimal. And so I got with a a new doctor and what we did is we so we started we changed so I'm going to write it up on my board. I'm going to make sure you can see that. Right. So yeah you can see that. So we changed it to subq and we did it multiple times a week specifically 3x a week. We didn't actually change my TRT dose, but we changed the amount of injections I'm doing and the frequency of the injections to make my blood serum levels more stable. Um, and that was the immediate change that they made as part of getting with this new doctor. Uh, and the the name of the the doctor was Matrix and now they're Matrix Reformed. They've changed names since then. Um, and realize I'm not with them anymore. I'm with an endocrinologist. um and everything like and we're we're kind of changed back to IM but we're still doing multiple dosings a week and this multiple dosing a week really drastically changed the way I feel. However, that wouldn't have been enough on its own. When I got with that doctor, we also implemented a GOP1. So, and in particular for me, Tzepide was the GOP1. So, So tzepide was I I felt as a safety data I actually requested tzepide of the two uh semiglutide and tzepide of the two that were available at the time I requested tzepide even though it's slightly more expensive because there were lower instances of gastric issues with people with that drug. So we put so we put me we changed my TRT dose. We got me on a GOP1. But that wasn't all. We actually added we actually added Anavar to that which is an oral anabolic right and this is where this becomes slightly controversial because at this point in time that's not a normal TRT uh that's not a normal TRT regimen but we did this because when I went to that doctor I said I want to lose this weight in six pound six months. months and I don't want to lose any muscle. Meaning, I want to take my weight from 242, well, 237.4 at that point in time, the whole way down to under 200 lb and not lose one ounce of muscle. This was one of the things that they added to make that possible because if you just do the GLP1, even with my TRT dose, I would probably be shredding muscle to to do that weight loss that quickly. Obviously, you can do it in a much more sustainable uh much slower rate and have and then there was one more thing that I think actually is a huge game changer for me that um believe it or not because before that I did not have so this is a erectile dysfunction medication normally right but they specific specifically put me on it um to increase my pumps in the gym. And I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's a vasod diilator. And so in taking that and working out, you'll see your future gains immediately. And I know that doesn't sound like it would matter, but for someone who needs motivation in the gym, and again, not a doctor, not advising this. These are all prescription medications. I got a prescription for all of it. But um you know I it was it was gamechanging to be honest with you. Um it was an absolute game changer and of any of them it has the highest safety profile of course because it's you know it's the most widely studied. It's used by millions of people. Um and honestly I would say it was one of the most in impactful things that they put me on. Uh so this was a stack that caused me to lose the weight. So before I was on one drug fentramine right post hospitalization they said you can never touch fentramine again. And so it took all of these things to to to to do this transformation. But I will say when I was taking fentamine to lose the weight I would lose a lot of muscle. And as you'll see from these progress photos I didn't lose that much muscle. Um, it was surprising. It was it was surprising how how well that worked. So, that's the stack. Now, I'll get into the progress photos and the dates just so that you can see all the references and then I'll explain the training, the calories, the other thing because that stuff all matters. Don't think that I just took drugs and lost that kind of weight. No, no, no. Everything was counted. Everything was calculated except one day a week and I'll explain that as I get there. Everything everything was controlled in this situation except for one one one month in particular. So what we have is August 4th I was 230 lbs and I'll have that picture down below. September 7th I was 220 lbs. You know picture below. Um October I was 213 lb. Uh November I was 202 lb. In December I was 200 lb. Now I didn't lose much weight from no November to December. That is of course holiday times Thanksgiving. So that's what happened there. But interestingly I lost a ton of weight in December itself. And in that situation, I was um off of TRT. So, I lost a ton of weight, but that was only because uh I was switching from the TRT clinic to the endocrinologist. She wanted to run a whole bunch of tests um at that point in time. So, I went off the TRT and she challenged me that I should not be gaining weight off the TRT. But one of my symptoms that that had me go on TRT to begin with was actually chronic headaches. And that's why she wanted to run all of those tests because that's not a normal symptom. So most people when they go on TRT, they do not have chronic headaches. It's a weird symptom and I noticed it and I explained it to all the doctors and in fact that was what caused my general practitioner to not even be willing to entertain prescribing to me. They kicked me to uh urology who then kicked me to endocrinology and finally someone was able to run a bunch of tests just to make sure that what I thought was the problem that caused me to have low testosterone in the beginning was actually the problem. And I'll full disclosure I broke a testicle. So I I broke one ironically not in jiu-jitsu. For a guy who gets kicked in the nuts three four days a week didn't break it in jiu-jitsu. I actually broke it, I'm pretty sure, doing work on my farm um in in a weird accident and I didn't have health insurance at the time to get it looked at. So, uh and and I only found out that I had, you know, major damage whenever I went to get a vasectomy. I mean, this is a lot of information and I figured it's only fair to share all of it because it'll explain how this transformation took place and it'll explain that you may not be in a position to make this transformation and you know depending on where you're at in life and what your goals are. But this is all and and then after that, by the way, because because I was off TRT and my endocrinologist had kind of challenged me, I I realized that the whole time I was tracking calories, but I had to track my calories meticulously every day and not have my cheat day. And sure enough, what I realize is I attribute headaches because post uh TRT, the only time I ever get a headache is if I'm dehydrated or hungry. So, if I'm wildly malnourished, I will get a headache or if I'm wildly dehydrated, which unfortunately signals me to also be hungry. Even with a GLP1, um I will think I'm hungry when I'm thirsty. it is just a thing that that that's the way my body reacts. So I have to be cognizant of am I hungry or am I thirsty. Uh and a lot of other people are that way too. So just realize if you're getting hungry and you believe that your hunger shouldn't be happening, especially based upon calorie tracking, you're probably thirsty, you know. And in fact, uh again, not sponsored by them in any way, but I take the element packets one per day, and that seems to really curb hunger. Um just because I think I'm dehydrated and thirsty. Take the element packet and boom, I feel so much better. So, that's the weight loss journey, but let's let me walk you through the uh the calories, the steps, and the amount of pounds lifted per day because this is where this gets to be ridiculous. And I just don't think I think going at it like say you're trying to make the same transformation, I would make it over a year had I not wanted to make the entire transformation over one winner. So, I wanted by my birthday in March to have this transformation done and be able to go outside with my kids and have a lot of fun over the summer. So, that was my goal and I was going to stop at nothing to make it happen. Let's just be clear, there was no stopping me. It was going to happen over this particular winter. So, what ended up happening in terms of steps? So, my minimum steps per day was 10K. Okay, my minimum steps was 10K. Just imagine my minimum is 10K. Um, I want to make sure that Yeah. Yeah, you guys can see it. So, my minimum is 10K. And the kicker is I have I have insomnia issues too, even without the fentamine. So, I always kind of attributed some of the insomnia to the fentamine. But no, no, no. In general, I have insomnia issues when my calories go low. You take my calories low and my insomnia ramps up. So, that's another problem where you drop my calories and you you wait till you see these calories. Um, and my insomnia ramps up. So, what did I do with that extra time? I had three, four, five hours every night. Well, that's simple. I ended up closer to 20K almost every day. anytime the insomnia would flare up, I would go downstairs on a treadmill, play video games in the middle of the night and that was my release for the insomnia. So instead of doing what I used to do where I do a bunch of research, I would, you know, kill time with YouTube videos. No, no, no. Was walking on a treadmill down to my basement every night to make that happen. So when the insomnia flared up real bad, boom, we did that. Then the calories 6 days a week. This is where this becomes impractical if you don't have a GLP-1 in your in your back pocket because I don't think I could have ever done this outside of having fentramine or GLP1. My caloric load was 800 to 1,200 every day except my one cheat day. My one cheat day per week was however many calories I wanted and whatever day I wanted. It wasn't a prescribed day. I just knew I could only have one within a 7-day period and I could extend it as far as I wanted, but I could not go below 7 days, meaning I couldn't have two in one week. So, I could have one every eight days, I could have one every nine days, but it had to be seven days apart. So, the minimum was seven days. Usually it would be once every one and a half weeks and that would be unlimited calories and I mean unlimited calories and I know that's not the best way to go about things because it ups your caloric load for the week but eventually I would need a break. And what's interesting is it was never the day before my my next so I was injecting the tepatide the GP1 once per week and you'd think ah it's probably the day before your injection. It was never that day. It was never the day after my injection. I can tell you that. But it was also never the day before or the day of. It was always sometime like seemingly four three three to three three four maybe even day five. You know what I mean? It's always one of those days. Could be as early as day three. It could be as late as day five. I'm just giving you some ideas around once a week injections. And I believe the half-life of this is 5 days. So you'd expect it to always be on that 5day mark, but it seemed like it could be that three-day mark for me uh of having hung hunger signaling that would drive me to just eat a bunch of food. And then in terms of lifting, I was lifting a much higher volume. I mean, I'm talking 30 to 50,000 pounds almost every day. uh realize at this point in time the sacrifices I'm making to get all of this right all of this done right so the there's no sacrifice other than being hungry and I wasn't particularly hungry because of the GLP1 but there's no sacrifice to the 800 to 1,200 calories but these steps and this weightlifting meant I sacrificed time with my family but it was calculated because my kids weren't in any activities over this winter they were still a little too young to be in activities And it was like a freezing cold winter. Like it was it was just a terri and my kids didn't want to be outside. So it was like kind of a terrible winter for us to do activities. They were a little bit too young. And so it was a perfect winter to get this done. And this is what I ended up doing though to make this weight loss. I'm not saying that this is what you should do. I'm not prescribing it. But I wanted to be transparent because I'm going to do most of these videos shirtless. Uh today's a rare example where I'm not doing it shirtless. But um I prefer to do it especially so that you can see the way my muscles are reacting to the exercises that I'm doing on the speed. That's part of the reason. And because I spent so much time building the physique I have today, uh that I I really, you know, you know, I I I would rather do them shirtless most of the time. Uh, but this one in particular, I think was going to be a little different than the rest of my videos and is more about transparency and honesty around the way I go about this. And then the realization that I've never done one naturally. I've never transformed my physique naturally in my life. I thought the second one where I was out running was natural, but I realized I didn't post about that physique transformation at the time. Uh and and my partner at the time was posting, it's not my current wife, but my partner at the time was uh posting about their transformation, not mentioning that this whole thing was done on a prescription drug, fentamine. And it's like, you really need to disclose that. You know, if you're gonna post about how you did all of this, first of all, she claimed I did all this naturally and it's because of this XYZ thing. It's like you can only eat this amount of calories if you're taking something or you have incredible willpower. Um, my only criticism of the liver king, you know what I mean? In particular, of all of the influencers that's ever been out there, my criticism of him was when he was calling people uh, you know, subprime and all of this stuff because they were taking things to get the results they wanted. And turns out he was on things the whole time. I mean, he he he actually had some deficiencies that caused him to go on it. And his stuff was all ran by a doctor, too. But it's like the most insane protocol from from his doctor. I mean, just realize that I mean that that protocol was was, you know, made this look like, you know, nothing, right, in comparison. Uh, and that was all done through doctors. So, I I would say be cautious about trying to get someone's particular physique and focus on making meaningful gains and improvements in your training. And and that's what I really wanted to focus on in general with my channel is making meaningful impactful improvements in your training and ways of doing that. It's one of the things that I strive for in life is trying to make improvements upon what I've already done and trying to adjust things going forward to to have better outcomes with minimal risk, right? Nothing is no risk. Uh and no medication, all of these medications have their own risks involved. I didn't go over all the risks, but you can just look them up. I mean, uh, you know, GLP1s, the the the risks have been all over the news of stomach issues. Realize I've had none. Uh, I never had any. I mean, the highest dose I took, the lowest dose I took, no issues whatsoever. Uh, you know, Anavar is is barely even in use and prescribed anymore. Tadalapil has had some, you know, some issues with people in the past. And uh, and dose also matters, right? So my TRT dose is I think 140 a week. So uh that mattered. We actually lowered the dose from what my prior prescriber was prescribing me but split it to three times a week and that very much helped um the splitting of it. Uh the GLP1 dose again you know these things should escalate and escalate slowly. If you get with a good doctor they'll run you through the full protocol. And I would say take your health into your own hands. Also look up all of these medications and question whether you should or shouldn't even attempt it. And you know really evaluate for yourself how quickly you want to get to your goal and how much your goal matters to you. For me I wanted to be the person I used to be and I wanted to do it in one winter and I achieved that. I I can now do anything I want. I can run with my kids. I can I can chase after them. I can do all the things I wanted to do by sacrificing one winner and sacrificing majorly to make this happen. All I did was work, walked, and lifted. That's it. Work, walk, lift. You know, the amount of time spent with my family over that winter was minimal. And uh but I knew if I did that, I would now be able to spend so much more time with them today because I don't have to lift 30 to 50,000 lbs to maintain it. In fact, I'm maintaining it on uh well, I did lift 40,000 lbs yesterday, but typically I lift 10,000 pounds a day. Um, and then every now and then I will sprinkle in one of those 40,000 pound days, but it's down to like 10,000 pounds a day roughly. And then I take some weekends off and spend it just with my family. Uh, that's what happened last weekend. That's why I got in as much lifting as possible. Yeah. You know, yesterday. So, that's one of those where uh I try to get get in the lifting whenever I can. And having these digital cable devices save me so much time in setup. I can just go to the machine, hit my custom workout, hit go, not think about it, put the handles on, put the bar on, whatever implement I'm using that day. I leave them at one implement per workout. There's never a workout where I switch implements. Um, so that it's even easier. And I also escalate it so that the so that the uh so that I don't have to move the positions very often on these. So it's up here, middle, and then down. uh there three kind of sections and uh and then the calories. I I could never do it without a GOP one. I don't get full and I'm constantly hungry. So, uh GOP1 versus Fentramine, uh in my opinion, I mean, I love the fentramine. If if if I ever got cleared by doctors that, hey, you can take fentamine, uh I would actually prefer to take the fentamine over the GOP1. I mean, that's just the honest truth. It was um it was just as hunger and appetite suppressing to me as the GOP one is, and it was a heck of a lot cheaper. It's like a quarter the cost. Uh the steps were outrageous. I mean, I don't get nearly that kind of steps today. I like to shoot for 10,000 uh steps a day. I really like to shoot for that. And I was falling short of it for quite a while. and I'm getting back to getting close to this number. I don't ever get this number. So, uh, very rarely do I get much more than 10,000 steps. I want to thank you for for watching this video. If you have any questions about the protocol, I mean, I'm pretty transparent with it, how I got here. It was a video that's taken me a long time, especially because I recorded it once and then realized I had my mic the wrong way. So, uh, probably because the nerves around recording this video, it's something that concerned me to record, uh, just because it's scary to put yourself out there and be open. And that's why, you know, a lot of people, you know, Liver King, my former partner, they're not transparent about, hey, I didn't do this naturally. I needed help. and not just the help of a doctor, the help of a doctor who's prescribing me something to make it happen. And just the reality of, you know, I I reached out and got someone to help me. Uh, and even the the transformation before that, you know, that was the same thing, a doctor. The only one I didn't do with a doctor supervision was the one in high school, and that's because the prescription drug that I used later on was over the counter back then, right? Uh, and I I didn't even it didn't even dawn on me that none of these trans transformations were done naturally. They were all done with some s sort of a pharmaceutical in place. Anyways, thank you for your time. If you have any questions about any of this, uh, I can either record another video if it's a if it's going to be really hard to explain. Uh, if it's something simple, I'll just post a comment back to you. If you post something in my comments and ask questions about it, I'm I'm here to answer them. I'm, you know, I'll be as transparent as I can be with any of the stuff that I've done to get the physique I've gotten today. And uh and honestly, you know, this stuff was impactful. It worked. And it's allowed me to maintain the physique. You know, having this GOP1 was what made it very easy to maintain the physique because you can dial the dose up and down whether you want to gain or lose. Uh by the way, taking it completely out, you get very very hungry. Uh, right now I'm pretty much off of it and the the hunger is real. Um, so it's it's tough to get off of these, but it's also tough to get off of fentramine. You get wild headaches from from the withdrawal of the fentamine or at least that's how it was for me. So it's not like GLP1s or it's a little different with the GLP1 you just get hungry. Fentramine it feels like there is like a withdrawal similar to caffeine. So, just be aware that uh ask your doctor specifically about, hey, if I want to come off of this, how do I? Because TRT I'm on for the rest of my life. Like, my levels were low. Uh they go to zero. If I go off of it, uh that 188 pound picture, I was off of it. My level went near zero. So, um, and thankfully I did get a clean bill of health like, uh, so I'm very relieved that I didn't have some un other underlying issue that was causing my low testosterone. And, uh, you know, I'm very thankful and very grateful for both your time and, uh, everything that I've been given in life. So, thank you. Have a nice day. Uh like, subscribe.
