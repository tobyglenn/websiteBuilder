I went from 242 lbs to 188 lb in the course of roughly a six-month time frame. Uh that set up the physique that I have today. So that picture of me at 242 lbs. Obviously, I didn't look the way I do today. And in fact, the first time I put that picture in one of my videos, the guys from Jiu-Jitsu were commenting saying, "Wow, we forgot what you look like back in 2023." Uh and and I looked like that for a while. um you know, slowly ramping up to finally getting sick enough about it to to do something about it in 2023. But I wanted to talk about specifically what I did to make this transformation happen. And in fact, this was the third of these style of transformations that I've done. Uh I was a morbidly obese kid. So I was very fat. I was very skinny whenever I was in elementary school and then I became very fat towards the the end of elementary school and then all throughout high school until my senior year. And what I didn't realize until I was talking to my wife was I had actually never done a transformation naturally. And what do I mean by that? Well, even in high school, whenever I went to transform my body from being a fat kid to a relatively fit kid, uh, my senior year, I actually used a now prescription drug called fentramine. And at the time it was over the counter, and I just ordered it off the internet, got it in, and boom, it helped me drop the weight. So I get tremendous hunger signals.
