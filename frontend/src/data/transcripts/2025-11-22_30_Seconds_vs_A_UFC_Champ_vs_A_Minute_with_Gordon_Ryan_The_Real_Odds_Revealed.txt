context of I could probably last in an MMA fight for 30 seconds against anyone by dancing around right by keeping them at bay and not getting hit. I could probably make it the 30 second mark hopefully. You know, there might be some people that they're just too fast and they end up clocking me, but uh and I don't get a takedown or I don't pull guard or whatever to get the to get the match on the ground. But there there's a bigger chance of me lasting for 30 seconds in an MMA fight with a UFC champion than there ever would be of a jiu-jitsu match with corner Ryan or Nikki Rod. Like like their ability to get get the match on the ground and get into an entanglement with a finish is just far too great. Uh, in an MMA match, there's so many ways to defend yourself against getting finished quickly.
