So, what's funny is for someone who's on Greg Duzette's side from a training philosophy perspective, his take on Mike Isert's jiu-jitsu is just pure garbage. And I figured after after watching that video, I'd have to sit down and talk about it because I watched Greg Ducet's video and it made me realize that him and Ariel Hwani, those guys have no business critiquing uh these people's belts, right? Now, Derek Moneyberg, there's a lot more to critique there. A lot more to critique.
