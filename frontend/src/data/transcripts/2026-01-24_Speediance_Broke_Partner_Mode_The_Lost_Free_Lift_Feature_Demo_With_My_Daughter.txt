Hey, welcome back to Toby on Fitness Tech. Uh, I'm Toby. This is my little daughter, Lily. I figured we would show off something on the Speedance uh before they take it away. So, I happen to have the V2 software of the Speedians down here. And I have the V3 software upstairs. And so today I wanted to demo uh real quickly something that's actually going to be removed when and is removed upstairs whenever I upgraded to the V3 software, but it will be coming back in a future upgrade. Like it's one of those things where or at least that's what the community has said. Um and the one Speedance representative that is part of that community did also allude to it was a mistake to take it out. Uh, but it's actually partner mode within Freelift. So, realize that there's two versions of partner mode. If I go into all workouts and then I click on one of these workouts, there's a partner mode inside of here. There's solo over here and then partner beside it. I click partner and that will actually allow me to log in. So, if I click start on this, it asks me who who each person is and logs them in. That's not what we'll be doing today. that is still there in the V3 software. So, there's a lot of misinformation online that in the V3 software, all partner mode is gone. No, just this specific freelift partner mode is gone. And this is the superior partner mode. By the way, if you want to partner and track your stats, you're going to do it that way. But for what Lily and I are going to do today, we are actually going to go into freelift. And this is the old freelift screen. Now, what made this really cool and why this was actually the kicker is this is gone in V3 of the software, but this was actually literally in all of their original demos. Okay. So, this was actually in all of the original demos of the um of the software. So, you see how I just clicked partner on the screen. >> Yeah. So, Daddy just clicked partner and now it gave us two different uh values. So, I have eight over here. You have eight over there. Okay. >> So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to set this up to the top. And this is something that only the Spedians can do, by the way. That is why this is something that they demoed in all of their early uh all of their early videos. So realize the kicker is they accidentally took away a feature that was in all of their early videos. >> All >> yes, it was in all of their early videos. And the reason why this was in there is because that it was actually something that the tonal could not do. So what was very interesting is this particular feature is something that the tonal can't do. And I'll explain why the tonal can't do it. So this is the this one. I guess it doesn't matter for this, but >> we've done this before. >> So no, we've never done this before. >> We never >> Yeah. No, before we were doing regular workouts. So what makes this different, Lily, is in this mode, you do not actually track your individual lifts, like your individual exercises. >> You just track the total volume. And when daddy click partner, you notice how it didn't require any kind of a login. And that's because whatever you do is not going to be tracked against uh against this account, but won't be tracked against any other account. It'll just show up in the workout report afterwards. >> Okay. >> So, for example, if I turn this on, Lily, is the Oh, >> there we go. >> Check mark. >> So, let me see which one this turns on. Oh, that turns both on. I was curious what it would do. So, I have to turn on individually now. So, even things like the Bluetooth handles, by the way, aren't actually designed for this mode. So, realize that this mode is here in V2 of the software, but it doesn't work properly. That should have turned on one of the two sides. But this this mode is actually I argued online that it was already kind of broken. Like, it's it's clearly not well uh you know, welldesigned to begin with because that's not tracking against an actual logged in user. So, I have two sides not tracking against a logged in user. And when I went to turn on the Bluetooth handle, I turned both sides on and two and the idea of this mode and what I wanted to show is so if I turn both of them off and I turn Lily on, can you pull this down at 8 pounds? >> Yes, I will. >> Can you pull it down? Okay, good. So, what I'm going to do is while Lily's doing that, I'm going to jack my resistance up. That might be too high. I'll jack it up to 44 pounds. Okay. And then watch what I can do. So, Lily, keep pulling down. So, Lily's pulling down and pull up. You see how our reps are counting individually? We can both be working out at the same time. This is something that only the speediance can do, by the way. We can both be lifting weight at the same time, but it's not practical, right? Because it's not tracking any of her stats. It's not tracking what movement she's doing. It it turns this into a weird functional trainer that has pounds of resistance per side, right? It's it's a completely odd thing to do, but the reason why it was in all their early tech demos, in all of their early videos, is because the tonal can't do this. And the reason why is this has two independent motors inside it that are tracking together to make in a normal workout these weights the same. And there's actually been software bugs where the weights don't go up at the exact same time. And boy, does that feel weird. They fix those very quickly, by the way, whenever one of those pops up. So, Daddy, what is this here? >> Does this count your reps? >> Yep. So, now you have 15 reps at 8 lbs, right? And daddy has 11 reps at 44 lbs. >> Probably because that's heavier. >> Wow. Daddy's lifted less reps than you right now. You are winning. Do you know that? >> Yeah. >> Do you want to do a different exercise? So, >> yes. So, what daddy was doing, you know how you were pulling down one-handed? You were actually going like this, right? Daddy has to get on his knee to do that same exercise. Oh, sorry. See, whenever I turn it on, it turned on both of them. It turned on Lily's side, too. So, you can tell it's uh So, you were doing this exercise, right? Something like this >> with one hand. >> We'll increase the weight for you and I will have you do this exercise, right? It's like a >> I was kind of >> downward. >> I was I was kind of doing this. >> Oh, you're doing this >> and then I was doing this. >> Okay. >> I was doing like the thing you were doing and then I did like this. >> What I want you to do this time and I think you'll be able to do more weight. Take one hand, put it on an inner grip. Take one hand, put it on an outer grip. And then we're going to swing it like we're swinging a baseball bat. You ever swing a baseball bat before? >> No, I don't do baseball. >> I was wondering. >> I know baseball. I don't do baseball. >> Have you ever seen baseball before? >> Not even once. >> Not even once. Huh. Well, that's kind of surprising. I didn't know you'd never seen it. So, we're here. >> The only thing I saw that's baseball is on YouTube and I seen Mr. Beast on baseball. What was >> I don't think that was baseball. >> Was it not baseball? Did they have a bat? Do you know what a bat is? Not a bat like the animal bat. Like >> they didn't have like a bat. They didn't have a bat. >> Mr. Beast was just running and holding like his helmet. >> Oh yeah. >> Well, that would have been field hockey. >> Usually. Oh, that could be field hockey >> because they're on the field. >> They didn't have a They had nothing. >> Oh. Anyways, I don't know >> the move we're going to do. You're here. You're here. You're coming down and you're coming across your body. >> Can I try? >> Yeah. Do you want to try it on your side? >> Yeah. >> So, do you want to try it at 8 lbs? >> Yep. Bring it the whole way across your body. There. That's where you want to end. That's with the weight turned off. Do you want me to turn the weight on or is just that enough? >> That's enough. So, one thing is with these digital resistance devices, there is actually weight when you're not when you have it turned off. Like this is not no weight. And in fact, uh when I had my shoulder injury when I was just getting started on these devices, I had to do some exercises with the weight turned off. Specifically, ones from the floor where I'm pulling up, I had a lot of trouble with it. And I I've gradually gotten to where I can not only load bear them, but load bear them with quite a bit of weight. So any kind of front pulls, but yeah, this is a pretty neat mode. It's just not effective for uh typical training. And you see all of this stuff on the screen. So it has all So the way the actual screen looks right now, and I apologize, you're not going to be able to see it. I'll put a picture of it down below, but the screen had all of the information filled out. So, it had my information, it has the guest information, it has the dynamic mode here, it has the accessory, and it takes up the entire screen. And it has easy to hit buttons in V2. That's all gone and looks totally different in V3. And for this mode in particular, it's it's really hard to use in comparison. >> Yep. But daddy, how do you know which line's yours on the thing? >> Oh, so the way to tell is the easiest way to do is if I turn on my weight, >> right, and I pull, I'm the green line. You see that? >> And then if I pull, >> you got to turn on the weight. Okay, you are the yellow line. You see it? And watch, we can go at the same time, which is pretty cool. See how we're both going at the same time and the waves are going back and forth. >> I kind of like it. We're like shows our each other. We're kind of like making knots. >> Yeah. >> If you see like it's kind of like we're trying to make a knot with our lines with different colors. >> Yeah. So, all of the stuff that I'm describing is gone in V3. The software. I'm just describing like what it looks like and a model basically. >> Yep. >> So, I'm going to be helping with daddy to make to describe this. >> Yep. >> And all this. >> Yeah. So, that's And then you had the d the dynamic weight modes are also still there in the V3 software. They're just moved down to the bottom of the screen. What they've done is they've made this screen look exactly like the workout screen in V3, which works great for the workout screen, but works really, really poorly for this screen. And one thing that is still weird in the V2 software that someone had brought up online is if I click barbell, I can't click it while partners turned on, right? >> And that's because you can't use the two motors independently in barbell mode. But like instead of making it so that the accessory doesn't have a a selection for partner, they just disable the button and don't show that it's disabled in V2. >> Look at it. I got 29 reps. You got 25. >> Yeah, you're ahead of me again. Is daddy going to have to pull ahead? >> Yeah. Do I have to do more reps? Is that what you're telling me? Less talking, more reps? >> Yeah. So we can show each other. I got 31. >> You got 31? Oh, I'm catching up. No, maybe not. >> I'm still higher than you. >> You do realize I'm not close. So now, if I want to put this into barbell mode, I have to turn off Lily's partner. So, I'm going to turn that off. By the way, right now, I've lifted 1,500 lb. Lily has lift 312 lbs. You've lifted over 100 lbs. You've lifted what? >> That's higher than That's >> That's five times your body. >> That's higher than I can That's higher than I can count. >> Yeah, she's lifted more weight than she can count. I >> So I turn off partner mode, right? And then I can select mode. >> There's only one one screen is what you noticed. >> Earlier when we had partner on, there was two screens. >> Now we only have one that's on 88. >> And now the problem with this, the problem with this mode, Lily, right, is we only have one screen now. And if I want to track you and I separately, there is actually no way to do this in the V2 software. In the V3 software, there's no partner mode at all. Right? So, there is no guest tracking in any way. But in V2, you couldn't actually track separately. So, what's going to happen here is I'm going to do reps and Lily is going to do reps. They're all going to count towards my volume. >> Okay? >> So, that's what we're going to do, right? So, we're going to do pull downs. Do you know how to do a pull down? >> Uh, what's a pull down? >> Okay. >> Oh, wait. I think I know how. >> You can tell me if I'm doing it wrong, but I'm pretty sure. >> Okay. >> I will do it. >> I don't know if I can do this with 88 lbs. We're about to find out. Right. So, I'm going to go here. Actually, I'm going to do a push down because I'm in front in behind the device. We're going to go here. Go back. Go here. in a downward motion. Okay, you got it. >> So far, you got three reps. >> How many do you want me to do? >> I want you to do 10. >> Okay, 10. >> What am I at? I wasn't counting. >> You're at seven. >> Okay, >> now you're at eight. >> Is that it? Is that 10? >> Yep. >> That's 10. If I want to have told you, you want to. >> Now, you notice my ring is on the barbell and it stays on the barbell all the time. And in my opinion, that is the only way to use this ring. I know the trainers show it on their finger. >> Daddy, >> I do not like it on your finger in any way. >> So, Daddy, >> but I do love the ring actually >> on the barbell. Daddy, what I noticed is when we were doing it together, there was only one green that was going up and not yellow. >> Yeah. >> What is the yellow? >> Well, the yellow is you. So, you needed uh you need to put more. So, the reason why your yellow did not go up and my green went up is because of the amount of force I'm throwing forward whenever I'm coming forward. So, that is an So, this range of motion is an indicator. You notice our range of motions were the same, like even the different points during it, but they were the same distance. That's because you were going as far with your motion as daddy was. So, you were coming across your body and going just as far, right? But daddy, whenever he throws, so when daddy moves his arms, he moves them with a ton of force, right? So the power whereas you were going nice and slow and controlled, it's not wrong what you were doing, but you were going a little slower and a little bit more controlled. Daddy applies a bunch of force like he's hitting a baseball, >> right? Because that is actually what he's simulating >> like this like >> Yeah. And you and I'm also throwing my hips into it really. So I'm actually not just using my arms. I'm coming through with my hips as I'm coming across. That's why that power meter was >> hitting the top of it. >> Okay. >> So, for this one, >> do you remember what daddy was doing? >> Oh, yeah. >> Yep. Okay. Come on. On this side. >> I'm on what side? >> Up against the thing here. Let me pull the Let me get this off of here. I put these little electric grate things to keep it from getting like dust and dirt in it. I think to do that I have to go here. Here. >> Well, there's already some dust and dirt in there. >> Yeah, there is. Yeah. Is not the cleanest down here. Okay. So, we go here. >> The way I thought you were going to make me do it is like that. >> Do you want to do it that way? >> Yeah. >> Facing the screen. So, yeah. Typically, when I do all exercises or suggest people do exercises, I suggest they do them facing the screen. When I'm shooting YouTube videos, I face the camera, right? But realize that this the way Lily is about to do it is the preferred way to do it where you're facing the screen so that you can turn it off on the screen if the weight's too much. Now, what I want you to do, Lily, is I'm going to move this over here. I want your hands here and here. Nope. >> This hand over here. >> So, what I'm trying to get Lily to do right now, and this hand on this one. So, there's this gnarling, and this is typical of weightlifting. There's gnarling. And I'm trying to get you at the very Is that more comfortable for you >> where it is right now? Okay. Scoot this hand over a little bit. >> Okay. I'm trying to get her hands even on either side. And now can Can you lift it? Can you pull it down without turning on the weight? Evenly the whole way to the ground. Lock out your arms at the end. How hard is that? >> Not even a bit hard. >> Okay. Daddy's going to turn the weight on. Bring it up as high as you can. High you can. that he's gonna turn the weight on. Ready? Can you still do it? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Now bring it down the whole way. I want your arms to lock out at the bottom. No. Can you do that? So come down. And now I want you push as hard as you can. Nope. Lock your arms out. Butt stays up. Okay. Good. Now come up. Good. Now go back down. Good push. There you go. That's better, Lily. Little wobbly at the end, but that is much better. >> Yes. I I'm not very good at stabling things. >> If I was doing that on a beam. >> Yeah, >> it would be way harder if I had it on like >> like 20 lbs. Yeah, >> I would have to be balanced while holding like a beam trying to like stable it. I wouldn't be able to hold it still that much. >> Yeah, I wanted to show everyone what this what this was like in the V2 software, especially because I'm very interested to see what happens when this comes back in the V3 software. This is my original gym monster that's downstairs, by the way. What's up? Look on the red next to the red button. >> The red next with the calories. Oh, what is it, Lily? What's >> 67? >> It's fun. >> Yeah. So, when we say 67, it's basically 67. But see, all of that all of Lily's lifting counted towards my my free lift volume. So now the free lift volume is all messed up, right? >> Because it didn't allow me to enter that you were the one doing those lifts. >> It didn't. >> No, it did not. So that that's the problem with the V2 software. What I'm getting at here is yes, this was removed with the V3 software, but it was bad to begin with. I mean, part of it is very cool because it's doing something that the tonal can't do because of the two two motors that are inside that can track independently. That is awesome that this has the capability to do that. But in practicality, without the ability to log in your second user, without the ability to do any barbell exercises and track them independently, this feature was already useless. Like, you might as well not have the partner capability. Um, the only benefit to the partner capability is the individual weights per side >> that you wouldn't be able to do if you were both kind of just lifting at the same time. >> Like, like what if my hand had like my hand on the on one side of the bar and your hand was on the other side of the bar? Would that count as both of us >> Oh. >> doing the workout? >> Yes and no. Right. Yes and no. and that both of us would be doing the workout, but it would still only count for me, right? And I'm pretty sure if I go to turn this on with the barbell attached, let me see what it does. Um, it's going to apply uneven force to the barbell if I adjust one over the other. So, I left it in handles mode. And if I turn up one side, what's going to actually happen is and then turn them both on, it's going to apply uneven force. Yeah, it's applying. You can see like that's awkward, right? I can't even do that. So, I can't turn it on and apply 51 and 8, right? What's funny is if I crank this up to 51. Um, so both sides now have 51. I have it in handles mode. I turn it on, right? I'll actually be able to move this, right? I can lift this. It's not a problem of being able to lift 51 lbs down. It's a problem of one having 51 and one having eight. Then I can't move it at all because that's I've never lifted a barbell where there's significantly more weight on one side than the other. And that's what >> then it would be like unevened and the bar would start to tip once you leave it. >> That's what was happening. I was only pulling this side down because I had this side at 8 and that side at 51 and I had it in handles mode because I I left partner on >> because then then it would be like then if you had it like daddy was lifting it then you would the other side would be doing the workout for you and then this side you'll you'll be doing the workout. >> Yep. And it wouldn't make sense because then it won't be giving like stuff to this arm. This arm will just have a little chillax break and then while the other one the other arm has to like work on this beam while like the beam works on the other side. >> Yeah. Do you have any other questions about this Lily? This freelift mode. >> Let me see for you. Do you understand why daddy doesn't ever use this in his workouts or recommend people use this? >> I know why. >> Why? >> Because because some things they delete off this that they that are great sometimes. >> Nope. Nope. Can you guess again? >> Even though this was fun today, why does daddy not use it? What's daddy's key tenant to the way he works out? What's the number one most important thing about daddy's lifting? Do you know >> progressive overload? >> I knew that. >> So the problem with this is there is no way to measure progressive overload. >> I have another question, Daddy. Yeah. What's this hand thing and the L and the R? Okay. >> Does the L stand for Lily? And does the >> the R stand for Rachel? >> No, no, no. The L stands for left and the R stands for right. Yeah. So, left and right. Um, and then the these hand things are assist modes one and two. And >> but what's the over on the left? And what's the over on the right? >> Oh, I think that means it's at zero right now cuz I just reset everything by clicking >> left and then zero right. >> Yep. So, if I turn here, I'll turn it on. Let's take the weight the whole way to the bottom. I'm assuming these are both going to go up to one. If you pull that down. >> So, you want to pull this down real quick. >> Oh, it says it comes on up on the thing. It says eight left, eight right. >> Yep. And that's because I have, by the way, partner mode turned off with it set to uh >> What if I try to lift it >> and not to barbell? >> Wait, but where's the green line? >> Where's the green? You mean the line that comes up here? >> Yeah, the green line. Where's it? >> Well, they're both going to >> uh Where is the I'm assuming they're both going to come up whenever I pull them. It's behind the yellow line. So, >> how do you do that? >> So, if I pull this down. Yeah. See? See how I pulled just one side down and the green line came down? If I pull the other side down, the yellow line cuz it's in dumbbell. >> But like try to make like a knot where you go dink don. >> Oh, you'd be able to do that. Yeah. If you go this way and then this way. You mean like that? >> Making helixes with your workouts. But that's really what this mode is good for. is goofing off or doing things real quick, throwing it on with your kid and just playing around. >> Um >> Ah, so funny. >> Yep. That's what that's what this >> But the actual thing that this is for is to work out with. >> Yes. And how does daddy prefer to work out? >> Doing this. >> Yes. But not in free lift with with the bench. >> I do use the bench, but um really >> Yeah, I do use the bench >> that you can't see in the video. >> What also is this not tracking? Do you notice what you're not ever selecting on any of this? So, we're selecting >> Yes, the hand. >> Oh, you really want these assist modes on. Let me show you what the assist. So, um assist one, last time I was demoing it wasn't working at all. Like, it wasn't turning off the weights. But assist mode two is actually pretty cool. So, Lily, what I want you to do is I'm going to turn the weights up, >> and I should be able to get assist mode, too, to turn. >> Why did it move? >> Uh, because it tightened itself. Uh, let me actually go to barbell. Sorry. Go to barbell, not the 48 lbs. That's going to be way too heavy. Let's make this 24 lbs. >> Let's see if I can lift it. >> Yeah. What I want you to do is try to pull it down. Okay. Towards you. Can you even Is this too tall? >> Yeah, it's too tall. Hold on. So, let me That's the cool thing with all these adjustments. >> If I was on my tippy toes, I'd be able to put down and go like a gorilla jumping. Point down. >> There we go. >> While he's doing that, >> let's move it down to L2. >> Okay. So, I don't know if you noticed that, but whenever I moved it down to L2, after I got it down there, I shook it a little bit. And the reason why is because especially on the Gym Monster 2S upstairs, these are a little looser. These are pretty tight on the original Gym Monster, but on the 2S, they're a little looser. And every now and then, it'll not actually be clipped in place. So, I have to wiggle it a little bit just to make sure it's clipped in place when I move it. I especially don't want it to like pop while Lily's trying to look. >> Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to pull down on it. >> Okay. >> Okay. Now, Daddy's going to turn it on. And now try to pull down again. Pull with all your might. >> Honestly, it's kind of heavy. >> Yep. The goal is to get See, it's dropping the weight down for you. You see that? So that you can pull it down. So that's what assist mode will do. It will do it mid rep. it'll decide she's not able to pull this down the way she's supposed to be and it'll drop the weights down. It's really efficient for drop sets. It's actually a great feature that in my opinion should be defaulted to on and should definitely not be at least in the V2 version of the software. If you turned assist mode on, it wouldn't assist mode 2 inside of your custom workouts. It wouldn't save that setting. That should setting should not only be saved once it's turned on. You should be able to turn it on at the system level to where it's defaulted to on on all on all uh on all exercises. I actually wouldn't turn it on, right? I I like not having it mess with my weight in the middle of the rep. Like if I'm going to failure, I don't want it dropping the weight for me. I want to go to failure, right? Which would then because it has the drop set mentality. >> Then you know which one you can't do and which one you can do. on this, they know which one you can do and then you'll know which one to put it on later if you want to do lighter reps that this prefers you to do. >> Yeah. So, Daddy doesn't like the idea of doing it this way, even though he thinks it's a an it this is, in my opinion, the best safety feature of the device. And it's it's not only defaulted to off, but it also it also requires being returned on every time you go to do your workout. Okay. >> Yeah. >> Are you good to go for this workout session? >> Workout session. >> Do you have anything else you want to say to the viewers? >> Yes. >> What do you want TO SAY? >> LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE. >> WHAT? >> Good job. What's >> wrong?
