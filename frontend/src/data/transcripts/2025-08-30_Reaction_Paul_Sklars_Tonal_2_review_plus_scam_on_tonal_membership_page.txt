They also have a total lie on their website right now where you get access to all your moves, right? That's one of the checkbox with without the membership. Notice I only have handles, bar, rope, and I have to manually adjust the weight. I have no eccentric. I have no nothing. That's what this device is like with it turned off. Paul Clark posted a video and he had the nerve in his video to say uh because I was looking at buying a Tonal 2 before I turned off the membership and actually his review plus just the way they handled the buyback program made me turn off the membership. That's when I said enough is enough. like that buyback program which I call the steelback program plus Paulclar's absolutely disgusting review of this tonal too where he had the nerve to say I can turn off the membership because I do all my own custom workouts. No you can't Paul this is what you get. You don't get the ability to track movements. You don't get the ability to track your weights. You don't get the ability to track your sets and reps. You don't get anything if you turn it off. Paul, you wouldn't know because your device was paid for and you don't even have the ability to turn off the membership on your device because they pay the membership for you, Paul. Which is what they do for all these review units that go out. The memberships are paid for by Tonal. Why do you think they don't get terrible reviews across the board?
