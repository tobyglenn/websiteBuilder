He actually launched me from inside the circle and he launched me onto the concrete. So he launched me from inside the circle onto the concrete, like off the mat onto the concrete. And so it was like, "Welcome to competition, Toby. Here's some concrete." Thankfully, I bounced off the concrete, got back up. There's no damage done. And went back and immediately restart the match in the center. And I don't even think they gave him his points for it, which technically he should have. You know what I mean? because he did actually start the takedown from inside the circle. Nothing about it was illegal. But, you know, and then I lost that match in overtime cuz I I gassed out, you know, first one in years. And I mean, this guy was in competition shape and I clearly wasn't, you know, in terms of like the amount of training going into it. I kind of knew that, you know, I'd have cardio problems when when the match went the distance and especially with someone with that kind of takedowns cuz the overtime is who gets the first takedown, which pretty much at that point in time I was, you know, I was not I didn't win the first takedown. I didn't win the second takedown because then he took me down inside the the and I reversed him and so that's how the points got to be, you know, tied at the end of the match, right? Uh, so I lost all three takedowns in that match, right? So, uh, and also that they were criticizing like Mike Mike's takedown ability, and it's like, oh man, if you're criticizing takedown ability, I mean, I have some decent takedowns, but, you know, I I was taken down by uh, you know, a blue belt essentially in my in my last tournament.
