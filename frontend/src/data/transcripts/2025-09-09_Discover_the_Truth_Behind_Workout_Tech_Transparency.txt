Uh, so Apple Health integration isn't there unless you have an Apple Watch. There's like small things that I wanted and I reached out to them. And the one thing is when you reach out to them, they say, "Hey, we're we haven't started working on this. We plan it for like Apple Health integration outside of the Apple Watch." They're like, "Hey, we plan it for Q3." And I'm a developer, so what that means is it's probably not coming by the end of the year, but it's on the radar. And for me, that's awesome. You know what I mean? for them to be transparent with, hey, hey, hey, this is on our radar. We already have it on our road map. It's just not it's not a high priority item. So, it's slated for to me is awesome because when you reach out to Tonal with feedback like you want an adjustable bench or back squats, especially back squats, it's dead silence from the company and the user community has to theorize they think back squats are too dangerous for us. The company won't tell you that. uh adjustable bench. There's there's never been an answer. Like this device has been out for five years plus. Doesn't have an adjustable bench. Doesn't support an adjustable bench. Doesn't support adjustable bench movements. And the company won't even tell us why. Whereas Speedance, it's like, "Yep, we've got this slated not the top of our road map. It's already in our to-do list." And I think that's just awesome.
