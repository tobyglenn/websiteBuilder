Hi, >> welcome to Toby on Fitness Tech. Today we're going to do something a little bit different. I call this series Liy Lily lifts. So, I've got my little daughter here and I figure we will explore one of my workouts on the speed dance and I will let her lift alongside me. What I'm going to do is I'm going to do the lifts because I do all custom workouts. I'm going to do my lifts and then I'm going to have Lily actually follow it and I will count her reps for her. Lily, >> how many reps do you want to do today? Do you want to do 10, 12, or 13? >> 10. >> 10. Okay. So, Lily's going to do 10. 10 reps. So, we will get started. >> Everyone who has watched Daddy's channel probably might know me. >> Oh, yeah. >> From my YouTubing streams. >> Yeah. Lily has started to stream YouTube videos of her own of her playing games. So our YouTube videos are different. My dad makes YouTube videos about wrestling about these products and I just make videos by video games. [Music] Okay, Lily, you want to do that side or do you want to wait till I do both sides and then do both? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> You want to wait till I do both sides? >> Yeah. So, right now I'm doing a kneeling single arm lap pull down at 104 lbs for 13 reps. This is my warm-up set. I skip these whenever I'm going through it because I can do both s especially with both sides even even during my normal workout. There really shouldn't be a rest between the two sides in my opinion. So, I go I turn it on. [Music] 104 must be the max because it's set to 70 here. So, whenever it's showing you on that screen, it must be showing you the 1RM value and not the individual lift value. >> I figured I wouldn't be able to reach the handles if I'm on my knees. >> That's what we'll see. I'm not sure. Okay. >> I mean, my arms are pretty long. >> Let's see. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Yeah. I can't reach. >> That's fine. Daddy will pull it down to you. Oh, are you going to pull it down? Ready? >> Yeah. >> Pull. One 10. Good. Other side. Got to do the other side. You can't just do one side. >> One. Two. Three. 10. Good. And my wife somehow got this handle twisted. So, let me fix this. This happened with the tonal, but it was a nightmare to fix on the tonal. When these handles would get twisted, you'd have to do all kinds of crazy things. exist. You can just do this and boom, it's untwisted. So, these handles are a lot easier to untwist. I actually had to watch a video on how to untwist the tonal handles when they get twisted. >> Everyone who watched my channel is probably know me just like I was saying earlier. Two. Three. What do you think, Lily? >> Yeah, you look like a butterfly just flapping your wings. >> That is what this move is. >> A butterfly. >> Do you know why daddy does this move? >> No. >> Help stretch out his shoulders. You know, in jiu-jitsu, we have that move called the armbar. >> Yeah. This is actually a move that helps well not necessarily prevent the arm bar, but at least make it so that the so that daddy can >> You do know everyone's watching you. >> Yeah. And they're about to be watching you. You ready? >> Wait, where's the other >> here? Daddy will bring it to you. Ready? >> Yeah. >> Is it butterfly time? Can you do this one? >> I can't do it. That's okay. >> I can't do it. >> That one's a little hard. >> I can only do two. >> So, this this exercise actually when I first got started because my shoulder was so messed up, I couldn't do it either. So, >> look at >> the 5 lbs was too much for me. >> I could probably do that one >> on the tonal. By the way, turn this way. Face the camera. >> Oh, yeah. >> So, uh yeah. So the the tonal whenever I first started that I couldn't do this exercise either and I had to actually turn I had to turn the weight off and do it with the weight not on and that was 5 lbs versus this is 8 lb. So just realize that that exercise is not necessarily an easy one Lily and because you have to bring the weight directly in front of you and if your shoulder especially if your shoulder's messed up it's going to be pretty bad. So this one's a bicep curl. You know this one, right? >> Yeah. And I probably can do that one. >> This one you should be able to do for sure. So, we're here. We'll have to move the we'll have to move the uh the uh the thing down to your height, the attachment points. But yeah, you should be able to do this one. So each time I do the move, you're going to move it down to my height. >> Uh just for this one. So this one, the other one were high to low movements. This one in particular assumes that you're closer to 6' tall. So come on the the uh machine and let's see where I need to do it. Probably >> right there. >> Right there. Okay, you ready? Other grip. So, underhanded grip. Bam. There you go. And then you're going to pull them towards your head, towards your ears. There you go. One. Now, back up. Back up. Two steps. There you go. Can you do it? Two. Three. Four. >> Is it this weird? >> Do I feel like I'm cheating? >> You're definitely cheating. There's no question you're cheating. Also, you switched your grips back. >> Yeah, I did. >> Underhand this way. You got it. There you go. One. There you go. That's a good wrap. Two. That looks a lot better, Lily. Three. Four. Five. 6 7 8 9 10. Good. >> Was that one exhausting? >> Are you tired after that? Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. >> I don't think she's faking it. >> You're just kidding. >> Okay, now for a regular lot. Pull down. Oh, put these back on. it already started. >> So, this is the really nice thing about th this machine. I can turn on and off the weights. It doesn't penalize me for doing that. So, I accidentally had it down at the the L2 spot. I just pulled I just pulled it up to where I need it. Turn turned off the weight, pulled it up to where I needed it, and now I'm turning back on the way. [Music] This one you should be able to do, too. What do you think? >> Seems a little bit easy. >> Is that one going to be easy? >> Wait, I already did that one. >> You did it with one arm. Now you're going to do it with both arms. Yep. You did it with one arm. Now you're going to do it with both arms. Got it. Well, I guess you don't even have to do it on your knees, do you? So, Lily's short enough still that she doesn't have to go to her knees to do lat pull downs, but that is the correct movement. Six. Seven. 8. 9. 10. >> I don't have to do it down to my knees. Daddy's the only one. This is like you're throwing a punch at the ground. [Music] >> I can't. And I'm doing that with 50 lbs with 25 lbs of extra eccentric. So that is >> that is a >> heavy enough that I have to plant my back foot. If you look at what I'm doing, my back foot is actually planted on the speeds itself and then my front foot is planted on the platform. So I've got back foot on the speeds, front foot on the and I actually have to rotate through this. So, if you look at him, he's basically stiff arming it and not rotating through. I have to rotate through because it's it's 75 lbs coming. It's 50 lbs coming this way. It's 75 lbs coming this way. So, I have to engage my core, which he's pretty much not doing in his version of it. But when you have this much weight attached to it, engaging your core is the only way to actually do this, even at the warm-up weight. And my workings that weight is even higher. You ready, Lily? Now, do you want me to move it down for you >> or do you want it up there? >> Move it down. >> Move it down. Okay. >> I'm kind of scared to do this move. You >> scared to do this? But we'll try one rep and see how it goes. You should be fine. I'll walk you through how to put your feet. Okay. Your foot placement matters more than anything else. So, which hand are you going to do? That hand? Yep. Then you have it right. This foot though, bring it back to the gym monster platform itself. Nope. The other foot. The one you had back, I think. No, actually it would be it's Yeah, it's the opposite way. So, switch your feet. There you go. And now punch forward to the ground. There you go. Whole way through. One, two. Good. Do you just want to do three? Three. Oh, you can go more. It's fine. Oh, P. Ready. You got it. Five. Six. Seven. >> Eight. Nine. 10. >> Try to get to daddy's hand. Can you get there? Oh, you can get there. Good job. Good job, bud. >> You want other side? Other side. We're not done yet. So, why am I encouraging her to do the other side? Because that's the most important part. >> No, it's not. >> It's definitely the most important part. So, there you go. One. >> Is that your weaker? Oh, yeah. Your left is your weaker side. Two. I could see it. >> Three. >> Four. >> You got a heck of an imbalance there. Five. >> Six. >> Six. Good. That looked good. >> Seven. >> That looks good. >> Eight. Nine. 10. >> Good job, bud. >> Okay, this is probably my favorite of all of the exercises. I don't do it the way they show on the machine. I do it the way the tonal had you do it. Uh, for this one, my attachments are already down here, but they have to be down here. And I've made the mistake of having the attachments as a top, and it actually won't reach to get a full stretch on this exercise. So realize this supine dual handle reverse fly I think is one of the best exercises on the machine. Uh and it was obviously one of the exercises that I also used on tonal before. But for it to for you to use it on this machine it does have to be at these L2 settings for me. >> I see you. >> Yep. What were you going to say, Lily? >> I see you. >> You see me? Oh, were you looking at the monitor? >> Yeah. >> So, yeah, this one is one of my favorite exercises, and you'll probably see why. This is how I think I've kept myself injuryfree is there's a bunch of exercises in here that >> that do a X. >> Yeah, they're stretching. So, I'm stretching out my shoulders with this exercise. And this one is an X. You're absolutely right. >> I know my ABCs. I know my letters. >> Do you know your letters? >> Well, sometimes I get my numbers wrong. >> Oh, do you get which numbers do you get wrong? >> Sometimes when I do my when I say numbers super fast, I just lose it. Yeah, I just lose my numbers and then I skip numbers. So, him in the video, in my opinion, is doing everything wrong according to the way I would work out. First of all, he's got the ring on, which, you know, limits your grip strength. Second of all, he's attaching himself to the metal, which you don't have the grip strength. So, I'm doing 27 lbs and 40 lbs on the eentric. And this is my warmup. So, you can imagine what my working weight looks like. Like, this is not light. This is an accessory movement, but I'm trying to progressively overload these also. I can feel this in my triceps, and I can feel this. Well, I can feel this pretty much all all over my arms. >> So, do you want to try this one, Lily? >> Um, I'll try. >> Okay, awesome. Oops. Sorry, Daddy. Daddy tried to move it to make it easier for you. >> I do >> other way. Head towards the unit. What are you doing? >> What? >> Why don't we have you try without the bench? >> So, what we'll have you do is the same motion. So, X your arms and grab. X. That's not an X. Nope. what daddy was doing. So, daddy had this arm on this one. Boom. That arm on that one. Now, he pulled him down and he pulled him across his body. Can you do it? No. >> Then you might as well switch your arms back because there's no benefit to doing it like that. There you go. That's just a lap pull down. H lap held on with a little bit of an axe. Guess I'll count that. Two. >> I made a mini X. >> Yeah. Three. >> Instead of making a triangle instead of a X. >> So, I think this is really important, by the way, for kids to start lifting when they're young. And I also think it's important for them to have fun while they're doing it. So for her, it's about safety and fun. So I feel pretty comfortable with her lifting with the machine's weights turned off. Uh she can lift some of these lifts with the 8 lbs. I tested it just to see what she could do with the 8 lbs with the weight turned on. But I think for safety and everything like that, if if I'm going to have her be on the machine, one, I have to be here, right? Oh, you can hear that. >> And two, uh, I'm doing it with the the weight itself turned off, which still, by the way, gives you >> probably three, four, maybe even five lbs of resistance depending on the exercise. >> I hear you. >> Yeah. Can you still hear me? Yeah. This is not no resistance with the machine turned off. >> What do you mean by resistance? >> So, resistance is the amount of weight you're pulling down, right? So you're making a pull in the machine and you're pulling a certain amount and that amount is not zero. So for people who thinks that's zero, it is I can assure you it's not zero. When I had a shoulder impingement problem early on when I was switching from free weights to this, well free weights to the tonal, I had to do a lot of exercises >> that got my hands sore. >> Did that get your hands sore? Yeah. I'm just going to chill. So, >> the other thing is her her little sister uh also does some lifting and she uses these little two-lb dumbbells. So, it's so cute to see, >> you know, the fouryear-old. >> What do you do? >> I lift eight lb dumbass. >> Yeah, I think we have them here. >> But >> daddy got them for for her birthday. >> Yeah. And I was unsurprised. My My wife was making fun of me for getting them for her birthday. >> She's right behind the camera. >> Yeah. So, uh, my wife was making fun of me for getting these for her birthday, but every single kid tried to use them. So, it was a pretty >> I I lift these almost well I I started lifting them in my bedroom when I woke up or get changed, but then I completely forgot about that. So then I really didn't do that. Yep. Can you lift them? Can you lift them just to there? There you go. One, two, three, four, five. So, these she can't lift the whole way over. You still can't lift them the whole way over your head, right? Nope. Nope. Not yet. >> That's super hard. >> I think you can lift what was it? The fives. The fives you could take completely overhead. >> Yeah, I can. We have >> Can you lift these overhead? >> Dumbbells. We have >> that way. That way. >> Dumbbells. We have two lb dumbbells. And that's all we have. >> Yeah. See, you could lift those over your head. You can see that your left side is definitely not as strong as your right. It's a lot off balancing, >> but good. Good job, bud. >> My head with a dumbbell. >> Yeah, >> I just hit my head. >> Daddy does that, too. Waxes on hell with stuff. >> Thankfully, he's never done it with them maxed out, but Okay, let's move this down. [Music] Can daddy get the bench back? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> So, this is not the bench that came with the machine. You notice when I'm in the office, I have tonal or speed's bench. This is just a random adjustable bench. So, it goes way off the platform, but it works for this purpose. There's no harm in using this. It's just it just isn't stabilized on the platform, but it's still pretty stable. It's stable enough for working out down here. I'm not doing my heaviest lifts down here. Usually, I use this one for warm up before jiu-jitsu. I do jiu-jitsu very early in the morning sometimes. So, if I'm going to the 6 a.m. class, I will do warm-ups down here and then go in. Unfortunately, that means that I'm usually not there till 6:30, so I'm uh late to the class, but I do like doing lifting beforehand. At least some kind of lifting. Okay, Lillly, you want to try this one? >> Which one? I wasn't watching. >> That's okay. All you have to do is sit and you're just going to pull them towards you, >> right? >> Sounds a little bit easy. >> Yeah. All you're going to do is pull the Do you need them down another notch or you got it there? No. >> Yep. You're just going to pull them towards There you go. One. >> Two. Not as easy as it looks, is it? Three. Four. >> I can pull them all the way down to the bench. >> Five. Usually you're trying to get them to your shoulders, though, which is even harder. There you go. Five. Ha. That's a row. Six. Now you're rowing. Seven. There you go. Eight. Nine. 10. Good. Good job, bud. Was that easy? It did not look easy from my vantage point. This is another one that wasn't on tonal that is on speed. And I really like this move. So, they did not have a a bench move like this, a bench fly like this. And I can tell you, I really like it. So, I had added it to my program whenever I was looking through everything that I could do on here. And I kind of enjoy this. Now, I've never tried it on my bench instead of the Speedians bench. So, we'll try it down here. I think it should be fine. >> What do you mean by speed? >> So, this thing is called the Speedance, Lily. Ah. >> So, you remember daddy's old cable machine that he had in his room that was bolted to the wall? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So, daddy replaced that machine with two of these machines. One down here and one up there. You remember playing around on the one that was bolted to my wall before? You and your sister pulling stuff, you know, doing the same kind of thing. >> Yeah. like like we playing on our bench, your bench, and then we doing random things with that. >> Yeah. So, I've always allowed them to play with it as long as they're supervised, which I know. >> Was that when I was five years old? >> Yep. That's when you were five. >> And my sister was three. >> Yep. >> Now she's four. >> Yep. >> And now I'm the six. Good times. >> Okay, we went through the whole workout. So, that was all my warm-ups. Now, we're into my working sets. >> Do we want to continue through the working sets or call it here? >> Call it here. >> Okay, come on up here with >> I think I need a break. >> Do you need a break? Face the camera. Do you want to give the outro? You got to tell people to like and subscribe. >> I already did that. and I whispered it to them. >> Oh, okay. Yeah. Thank you for watching. >> I'm still going to do that. Like and subscribe. >> Yeah. Oh, my buddy. So, yeah. So, have a good day. >> Have a good day.
