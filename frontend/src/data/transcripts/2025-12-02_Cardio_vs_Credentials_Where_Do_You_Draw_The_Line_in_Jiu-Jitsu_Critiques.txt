So, like you can throw that same criticism at me that you throw at Mick that uh Mike Israel that he's not in the kind of shape he should be in, right, for for jiu-jitsu, right? That's a fair critique, but that's a critique not of his belt level, but of his cardiovascular system, right? Like that's a that's a different critique. And to not wrestle up in that situation, I agree. like I would be wrestling up, but I'm also almost a 100 pounds lighter than Mike Israel and I have a lot more control to not fall on Nikki Rod.
