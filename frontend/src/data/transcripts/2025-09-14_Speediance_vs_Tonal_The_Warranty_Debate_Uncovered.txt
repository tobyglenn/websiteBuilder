Uh even the tonal like and the tonal company is not going to be any faster than these guys. In fact, they might if you're out of warranty, good luck even having tonal do anything without saying pay us first. You know, they're not going to from my experience with that company, they're not going to they're not going to support you in any way. Speedian is if you're out of warranty, they'll say, "Hey, here's the replacement parts. Here's how to do it." They'll send you links on step-by-step guides.
