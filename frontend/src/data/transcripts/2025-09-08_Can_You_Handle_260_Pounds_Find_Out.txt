I'm interested in dropping. So, first steps first. If you're going to do something like this where you're lifting heavy, I'm actually going to put a rash guard on. And you'll see why in a second. Um, when when you're lifting, so if you're lifting anything that's above your natural weight or if you're pulling out from the machine and you're light, and this is something I experienced when I was 185 lbs. Right now, I'm walking around at 200 lb. So, I don't quite have that problem or have as much of that problem and I'm not pulling quite as much weight as I was when I was really focused on a strength phase at that lower weight. And so, when I was doing that, the solution to this or the best solution to this in my opinion is a weighted vest. So, what we're going to do is we put this weighted vest on, right? And then I put the weights in the front of the vest. I put all the weights on the back of the vest already. I'm going to need the maximum amount of weight that this thing can do because 260 lbs will pull me around.
