And Ariel Hwani had done this with Derek Moneyberg also. And so these two guys don't know what they're talking about and it really bothers me. So Ariel Hwani's comment about to Derek Moneyberg that just made me realize that Ariel Hwani doesn't know what he's talking about, right? And and Ariel Huan is like, "Anyone should be able to last 30 seconds. What are you talking about?" out and it's like you obviously don't know what jiu-jitsu is because when you have someone that fast, that skilled, that strong, and has all of those intangibles that Nicki Rod has, he runs through you. Uh, and sorry, it wasn't even Nicki Rod, it was Gordon Ryan, who also has the capability to run through people. I mean, he's run through world champions in under 30 seconds. Like, Gordon Ryan has a a win loss record that's incredible. And Nikki Rodriguez is another one, right, where you put me in there with those guys and they decide they're like, if they're playing around with me, sure, I could have it last 30 seconds, but if they decide they're going to make an example out of me, I don't last 30 seconds in there with those two. So for Harry Ohani to say that, it it shows his lack of knowledge on the sport. And Greg Ducet did an even more insulting video when it's very clear that the Mike Ezrael Johnny Shrive match Mike Isertel's goofping around and the other person didn't use much from that video because it really doesn't paint Mike Ertel in a negative light if you watch the full because that that I had actually seen back whenever they shot it and I you know my takeaway from the that match whenever I was watching ing it as Mike Isertel's goofing around.
