Uh, and so if someone Mike Isertell's size decides they're going to drop down and forward, right, uh, you know, they they literally could break my neck and it's just a risk that I'm willing to take to try to hit those submissions, right? So, I I take risks, right, in my jiu-jitsu, and [laughter] that match could end very very badly for me, but it's a match I'd be willing to take, you know, and I've done I've done that same thing up on my neck. I've actually had to one point in time, I realized the person was going to come down on me and I had enough time because they they were slow enough to to shoot myself underneath their legs. So I shot my head underneath her legs to to to avoid, you know, getting my spine busted in half and my neck, you know, shattered. So I I did, but that was a white belt. That is not someone who's a black belt. That was a white belt who decided he's going to drop all his weight down on me and thankfully he's slow, right? I can't imagine with the speed of someone at Brown, black, you know, even upper purple bell, right? I'm not gonna have the kind of time to react.
