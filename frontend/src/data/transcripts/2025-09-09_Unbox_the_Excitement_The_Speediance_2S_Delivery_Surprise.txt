Full disclosure, when it was delivered, by the way, it's delivered by pallet to my house, uh, unlike the original Speedians, which was actually just straight up delivered into my house because they had to they brought it up on a dolly and it was a lot smaller of a package because it didn't have a bench in it. And I think anytime you're buying one with a bench, I'm pretty sure it'll come um in a pallet. So, it would it was delivered via pallet. And I'm not sure if that's all of them or specific to the 2S, but the 2S was delivered on a pallet, which is kind of a big deal because that was delivered right into my house. This one was delivered to the other end of my property, and I had to figure out a way to get it from there into my house. And it turns out that unboxing it outside and bringing it the whole way back across my property into the house, not too big of a deal, but definitely a shocker.
