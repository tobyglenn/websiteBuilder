for Derek Moneyberg. Supposedly that was his primary focus to do that in three years, but you would expect him to have done some sort of competitions in those three years just to solidify his placement. And I mean, even Mark Zuckerberg did a competition, right, under a fake name and went out there and won. I think the criticism of Ariel Hwani should have stuck around the lack of competing and that excuse that, well, I'm in my 40s. Well, there's a ton of people who compete in their 40s. I mean, there's a whole division in jiu-jitsu of 40 plus that most competitions have. Uh, now 40 plus brown belt is not going to exist, but you know, for him to have done no competitions at any of them is pretty shocking. Especially when you're being trained by world champions like that, you know, I would I would I would want to go out there and test myself and and in fact at purple belt I didn't and I was mad at myself for not doing it. So I competed white competed and won at white belt, competed and won at blue belt and then didn't compete at purple belt and then I obviously I got a third place medal uh at brown belt. So I did I meddled but I didn't get that first place that I got at all the other belts. um other than purple belt and purple belt I didn't compete but I was coaching you know and I wasn't in the like I wasn't in any condition to compete for most of Eh.
