Now, this could all be avoided by doing what I talked about in the previous video, where what I'm going to do is I'm going to go in here and pick stamina, and then I'm going to set my weight to or sorry, I'm going to set my yes, I'm going to set my weight to 15 and I'm going to set my training to to Sorry, I'm going to set my weight. I'm going to set my weight to 20 and my training to 15. So, weight's going to be set to 20. My training is going to be set to 15. I'll put a picture of that down below so that you can see exactly what that looks like, too. What I'm doing here is I'm superficially using stamina mode to give me a value that is way lower than my 1RM capability. and that will actually give me a warm-up set. So, I would avoid this customize alto together for warm-up sets, especially based on that person's posting. And this will give you a warm-up set because what you're doing is, and this is where it gets very, very weird. What you're actually doing in here is you're setting your value that you're going to lift to 20 reps of that 1RM value and you're actually only doing 15 of them. The machine will not reset your PRs in this case. It will say this is not your PR capability. You're intentionally doing this. My fear with customize based upon what this user showed online is that customize is actually resetting your 1RM value when it shouldn't. And I can't explain that and I'm not sure if that is always happening or only happening to that user. My guess is it only happened to this user. And my guess is it happened to this user because they didn't do the strength score ahead of time. So, it didn't have a true 1RM northstar to set you to.
