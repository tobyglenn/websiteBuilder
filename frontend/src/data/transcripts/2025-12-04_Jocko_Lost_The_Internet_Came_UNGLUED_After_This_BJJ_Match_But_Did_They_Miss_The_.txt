tatted up, bald guy, short, ironically, like Mike Israel size individual, but with a giant amount of tattoos. Of course, now I'm blanking on his name, but he's a former jiu-jitsu champion. Like, he's a former UFC fighter. Like, and and this guy uh fought Joo Willing in a jiu-jitsu match and obviously that did not go JO's way, you know what I mean, to face a champion like that. And I saw comments under that like, "Oh, Joo sucks." and stuff like that. And I'm like, "This guy is one of the best in the world." And he's facing him when he's on top, like before he went to Russia, you know? He's facing him literally off of a UFC win, like in a jiu-jitsu grappling match. And he's a jiu-jitsu expert. like he's not, you know, you're facing a jiu-jitsu expert who's a monster of a human being who's bigger than you in his realm.
