Hello and welcome to Toby on Fitness Tech. Uh this will be a video back on the Speedance. I wanted to talk about the one rep max calculations on this device. And the reason why I wanted to do that specifically is someone bought a Speedance 2S and then uh claimed that it couldn't do 260 lbs. Obviously, I've showed in past videos it doing 260 lbs, but I've only ever showed it doing 260 lbs in free lift mode, right? And not within an actual lift. Um, and the lift that I can of course do easily at the 260 lbs is the deadlift, right? That's that's the one that, you know, if you're going to be able to do one lift at at the max weight of the machine, that'll be it. I do have deadlifts in one of my programs and the user claimed that it couldn't do 260 pounds because they went in, they went in and hit customize and typed in a value and anytime you type in any anything over 220 lbs, it actually drops you down to 220 lb. So realize if you buy this machine and you use the customize setting, so if I go in here, I go custom, I uh add freely custom, right? add a movement, pick any random movement and try to set a go in and you have the gain muscle stamina strength which is what I talk about all the time that in my opinion most users should only ever use these and never use this customize se section and if you go in and hit customize and then you enter in oh this one of course is not one uh exit add freely custo Custom add movements. Uh let's pick Bench. Bench press. Okay. Search. Pick this. Add. Go in here. Hit customize. And then you can see your your amount of pounds that you're allowed to enter is between 16 and 220. So I actually can't enter into this machine 260 pounds. It'll bump it back down. And that user was claiming that there is no way to get this machine to do 260 pounds outside of freelift. And the user's dead wrong. And I didn't know ahead of time how to get to all these settings. So, I'm going to describe it. If I go into my deadlift custom workout that I have, so in here, it'll show that I have 225 lbs per nine reps. That means that it's already set to over the 220 lb limit. If I go into stats, I can actually see uh that is the stats for this particular workout. So, if I click on barbell deadlift and then go to stats. So, what happened there is I clicked on stats. And this works the same in the app as in on the device. And I usually do this in the app. Seems a lot easier when you're clicking around in the app than trying to tap all the screens in the device. But these are two different stats. So, if you're on your workout and you click stats, this is the stats of doing the workout, right? And and it'll have details there. If you click on an individual lift within the workout and then click stats, you will actually get all of your data on that particular that particular lift. Now, you notice something really weird about this. My one rep max for this lift in particular, it shows it at um so it shows it at 293 pounds. That's a lot easier to click inside the app, by the way, but it shows you 200 and this one's blank. So 11:15 I did a workout and I was trying to get a new PR value and it's blank and I don't know what that means. So that's what I wanted to test today. One thing I've noticed with this version of the software uh in general whenever I'm doing all workouts, so if I go back and and pick on one of the workouts that I'm actually that I actually did recently, and the the easiest way to look at your workouts that you've done recently is you click on this little like notification thing at the top right hand corner, the very righthand corner. It's usually red. You click on that and then once you're there, you click on one of your workouts in particular and then from there you get this screen and there's a um and I think you click here to do it. Yes, you click So what what happens on the device is you have to click in one more time and then you click stats. Here you can see your stats for the actual workout that you did. And you notice my volume was increasing uh 1112 the volume's here and then it increases 1116 and then 1119 my volume actually decreased. And this is what is odd and I think it's particular to this version of the software on the speeds. Realize they're constantly tweaking. They're constantly changing the software. This version of the software appears to not be progressively overloading you in any way. Um, and the reason why I say that is even though these volumes increased, these volumes increased by me doing more reps of the individual exercises within the workout. So, it's the exact same workout three times in a row. 11 12 I did a set of reps. 11 um 116 I did more reps, right? And in those times, I noticed that it was not progressively overloading me. So doing additional reps on top of sets on this device in general with what I've seen across all the software versions doesn't trigger it to progressively overload your next workout. Uh it would on the tonal. So if you do more reps the next workout, it progressively overloads you. And this version of the software in particular doesn't seem to protect progressively overload you in any way. And I think that's because they had a bug in the last version of the software that people were complaining online saying that it was progressively overloading them too far. And I did see that with one lift in particular uh of my own where I looked as the the weight that it was trying to give me and I'm like, well, I can't lift that. [laughter] There's no way I can lift that. I I mean, luckily, I know enough now having done this for years that I look at the weight and I'm like, I I can't do that weight uh without even trying it. And uh then I just backed it down and everything was fine. But this version of the software isn't. So that was me upping the amount of reps I'm doing. And then on the 19th, my volume actually went went down, right? So it actually went down by like 300 or so. That's me actually pring on every single exercise. But in order to do that, I had to only do the fixed amount of reps I was supposed to do with the weight set higher. So, I cranked up the weight about five between two and six pounds depending on the exercise uh to what I thought I would be comfortable lifting for the amount of reps. And then I hit a PR value on every single exercise. And you can see those PR values if I go back outside of the the workout itself. And I showed you on deadlifts how to do that, but you can do that on any of these. So if you go back out and go into one of the individual exercises, you can see your PR value, your one rep max value, your max. And I believe there's a way to see. Is it not possible to see in here? This might not be something I can see from inside here. So I can see it from the other screen, but I guess I can't see it from that screen, which is interesting. So to see what I'm trying to explain, go to custom. I go to the actual workout itself. I click on one of the individual exercises. So, tricep push down, right? And then click stats. And this will give me my one rep max values. So, what happens is inside of your inside of your looking at the workout itself and then work the breakdown of it after you've done a workout, you can't see this information or at least I couldn't find it really quickly. Uh but from inside here you can see it which is inside the workout itself as if you were going to start the workout. And this will show me that my one rep max did in fact increase. So before the one rep max was 110 on this exercise. It went up to 117. And again that's by doing its prescribed amount of reps but with a higher weight. And it looks like it's not automatically adding weight like it did in previous versions, but that probably got turned off for safety. And I don't know if it'll get turned back on in the future, but just realize right now that's it's it's not progressive. You have to do it yourself. Um, and then by the way, next time I go in and do a workout, it's going to use those new PR values to set everything inside my workout. So, my warm-ups will be slightly heavier. Everything will be slightly heavier on the next workout. That's the whole idea of my approach to working out. I was just shocked that um doing additional lifts was not hitting new PRs. And I noticed it like you see you see it on the screen when you hit a new PR. Uh unlike Tonal where it has three different PRs, um which is confusing by the way, uh to have three. They have a volume PR, uh, a strength PR, and I forget what the other one is, but, um, it's even dumber because volume and strength actually matter. The the third one doesn't even matter. I forget what it was called. But, uh, the problem with it is the only PR that the tonal cares about in order to set the weights is the is the strength PR. But it strength PR if you did additional reps it would count those reps and and re-up your PR value based on that. This I actually kind of like better now that I know that it's doing that because I can continue to press progress the volume on my workout until I feel comfortable with a new weight because I'm hitting like so I'm supposed to be doing 13. I'm hitting like 16 17 18 reps. At that point in time I need to up the weight. uh and go back through it. But that also kind of keeps my warm-up weights a little lower, a little longer while I'm hitting these, you know, multiple reps above the prescribed amount. And I actually feel like that's a little safer uh because the warm-up weights on this are slightly heavier than the warm-up weights from the tonal. So, it's I actually kind of like it now that I realize that it's doing that. But let's talk about the PR system in general. Because the one thing that I couldn't figure out based on that deadlift is what happened with that last workout that it gave me dash dash for my PR value. It's one of two things. When I set the the original PR, my working weight was 195 and I did it for an amount of reps that would set my PR value to 293. I think it was 13. So I was at 195 for 13. That sets my true one rep max to 293, right? Because your your one rep max is not 190 195. It's something much much higher than that because you're doing it for 13 reps. So, what I'm going to try now, and the problem with it is I don't know if that PR value was set properly because the weight was below 220 or because or the the last time I tried to do the workout, it didn't give me a new PR value because I did a completely different amount of reps to what the prescribed value was. And so, it didn't give me a new one rep max. just didn't didn't apply one. So, I don't know if anytime you go above 220 for the initial value of your lift, the machine will say, "Huh, I'm not going to give you a new one rep max." or if it's the or if it was just a fluke because I had the value set to 260 and I was doing more reps and I had set the volume down to three which might actually not hit a new PR and it just decided we're going to throw this away as it does with anytime you do extra reps without increasing the So anytime you do extra reps and do not increase the um the value to begin with. It just throws all that away and it says that's not a new PR, but it doesn't penalize you. It doesn't penalize you unless you've backed off the weight. So, if you back off the weight, it penalizes you and gives you a lower PR, which is expected. Uh and that's, by the way, that's acceptable. If if something happens and you get injured or something like that, back the weights off and set it to the new PRs and then slowly progress yourself back up. I've had to do that many times with injuries. I had to do it even with this finger injury where I worked out just onehanded, then I worked out two-handed with a a slightly lower weight on both arms, and now I'm back to full weight. That that's expected. That's part of your training journey. just in case you're not there yet. But what I wanted to try today in particular is a max weight barbell lift and see if I get a new see if I get a new one rep max. So, what I'm going to do is go in and go to custom. And then I have this deadlift workout that is literally just one set at 9 RM for 12 reps. Okay. So, [clears throat] what that mean what I'm actually going to do here though is attempt to do 260 lbs instead of the 225 lbs that it gave me for 12 reps and see if I get a new PR value. Realize this is a lot of weight. So, and this this will let me know if I got new PR values because I was below 220 or if I just didn't get a new PR value because it ignores reps that are above the prescribed amount. So, for example, I have unlimited sets turned on. If I do 14 reps and I was supposed to do 12, it ignores those last two reps. I'm thinking that's the case, but I don't know until I try. I figured I'd try it live so that everyone could see me attempt this. Okay. Now, normally whenever I do deadlifts, I do them towards the machine. I'm actually going to do them towards the camera. Today, just realize that I'm a firm believer in doing everything towards the machine when you can because then you can hit the stop button on the machine as along with having this having the ring to be able to hit the stop or start. So, I'm going in here. My ring is now connected, right? I connect it typically before I hit that start button just so that it's already connected. I'm hitting the start button. It's setting my weight to 225. You notice one that user who said, "Oh, it can't set the user said it can't ever set it above 220 pounds." Like in the dynamic weight modes, it won't set it above 220. He is dead wrong. Thankfully, and I was a little worried because I I didn't remember whether deadlift was above 220 or not two above 220. The answer is it is above 220 for me. Uh so, as long as you're using dynamic weight modes, this machine behaves the way you would expect it to behave, at least with your one rep max, but his one rep max is not set correctly. And I want to see if bumping this thing up to 260. So, I'm going to crank the weight the whole way to 260. So, bumping it up to 260, I want to see if that would have been all he needed to do to get his one rep max calculation to be correct. Uh, or if there was something more complicated he has to do. Okay, so, we're going to attempt this right now. This is going to be 12 reps at 260 lbs. And I'm going to put my mouth guard in. I know that sounds weird, but something like this could cause me to bite my lip. So, just realize that whenever I'm lifting very very heavy, I don't wear a mouthguard in jiu-jitsu. I don't really worry about it. I don't bite my lip. In fact, I usually chew gum while I'm I'm one of those people who chews gum just because it kind of takes my mind off the roll a little bit. But when I lift, I wear a mouth guard. When I lift heavy. I don't always, uh, but like with that arm workout that I was showing, I don't ever wear a mouth guard, although I might have to here soon. But when I'm doing something like this where it's the max weight of the machine, a mouth guard goes in. [snorts] >> [groaning] [snorts] >> Okay. Well, that's not a good sign that it did not immediately show me a PR or at least I didn't see it there. So, let's see what the stats on this shows. So, huh. No, look at that. I was wrong. Maybe I just didn't turn around in time. My new one rep max is 388 lbs. I apologize for being out of breath. There's no way to do this test in particular without being out of breath at the end of it because no matter what I do, I have to lift more than 260 pounds. You can see my it shows total volume PR max weight PR one rep max is now 388 pounds. So literally this user just had to use his machine once with the dynamic weights. Crank the weight up and he would have been good to go, which is what I had figured. So the the poor guy was like freaking out online saying, "I'm going to charge back. The machine's totally broken." and he had he just didn't understand how the one rep max calculations work. And I'm not even blaming him because I didn't know how they worked. But it it it works as expected except that unlimited sets does not actually cause the the the one rep max to go up, the the PRs to be hit. But if you lift, my fear was if you're lifting above 220, it won't give you a new one rep max just because I got a dash dash max whenever I was trying it the one time in particular. And you can actually see this if I go to the diagram. Uh that's not the the place I want. So what's funny is I forget that it doesn't show it here, right? So, it's not showing the piece of information I want. So, what I have to do is I have to click back. I have to click my deadlift workout. I have to click the barbell deadlift. And then I have to click stats. So, this will show me exactly what I want. So, what you see what you should be able to see now, you might not quite be able to see my screen. Ah, you can see it a little bit. So, what what I'll show you a screenshot of this down below. Uh, but what you see now is my one rep max is way up here at 388. Um, and you can see the volume on 11:15, which is even more interesting. The volume was higher, right, for the same workout done, the volume was significantly higher, but it didn't give me a one rep max. It didn't give me a one rep max because I was only supposed to do three three uh reps and I did like 13, right? So, that's why I have this massive volume with uh with no PR value. But you can see when I went in and did the prescribed amount of reps, cranked the weight up to where I wanted it to be, I got a new PR value. And now all of my workouts, unfortunately, will be set based upon this new one rep max, which means this is going to get real heavy. This machine is gonna basically set itself to the max weight all the time for me, [laughter] which is totally okay. But that is so that's the basics of this the the one rep max and PR system. It's complicated and different machines do it differently. I like this system. You just have to be aware that turning unlimited sets to to on and doing extra reps doesn't automatically reset your PR values. And that's actually helpful because as you're doing more reps, you you kind of remember like week to week, hey, I definitely did over 10, you know, over 13 reps. Uh, and eventually it gets to where, okay, I'm doing a ton of reps on every exercise. I've definitively gotten stronger. Let's test this out and jump the weights up. Uh, and then once I jump the weights up, I get new PR values. Those PR values get plugged into my workouts. And that's the way I'm that's the way I'm progressively overloading. I think it's actually a safer, slightly slower approach to pring because one of the problems on tonal is you had to put it into recovery mode a lot. if you're someone like me who does other sports uh because I couldn't handle the loads that it was trying to give me uh because it was constantly trying to PR you and then it would really penalize your your PR values if you were slightly weaker one day whereas if I'm slightly weaker and I'm just doing extra reps and I'm slightly weaker I'll just do less extra reps and I can track all of that. One user was asking, "Are these things that much better than a functional trainer?" And the answer from from my perspective is they are infinitely better. I had a functional trainer sitting in my garage and it barely ever got used. And in fact, I donated it to my jiu-jitsu gym because it was just taking up space. uh these machines and the tracking they provide I think is hugely beneficial and not necessarily for the tracking but for the fact that I don't have to think about this stuff. I only chose to think about this because a user said that the machine couldn't do 260 lbs outside of freelift. And I thought that that was untrue, but that brought me down this rabbit hole of how is their PR calculations actually being done and what constitutes it pring. And so I had kind of started to notice that as I was doing more and more reps, it was not giving me new PR values unless I up the weights. And you know, that was one of the things I noticed, but I wasn't sure how did I get that PR for deadlift that was above 220 lbs. You know, how did I get something that was like far in excess of that right at 293 originally and now it's at 388. Um, so the the answer to that is of course just lifting on the machine. Had this user lifted on the machine a little bit more with these dynamic modes turned on, he would have had values that that matter. And also I I I do all of my workouts with the eentric mode cranked up to max. Every time I create a new workout with new exercises, I have to go back in and crank that eccentric mode eentric mode up to max on each of those on each of those uh exercises. So any new exercises in a new in a new workout have to have it cranked up to max once. So, my first lift of a new workout is going to be all over the place in terms of like in terms of the volume and everything like that and in terms of the amount of weight lifted and then it progresses from there. And that's just the nature of the way I lift. And I just wanted to make people aware that settings inside of workouts stick. The only thing that weirdly doesn't stick is the assist mode. So, if you go turn on assist mode two, which is if you're going to use assist mode, use assist mode two. I had a whole video uh kind of showing off the assist modes and and uh assist mode 2 is the way to go. It is far far safer. It drops the and specifically the videos about drop sets and assist 2 and you can use Assismo 2 to create drop sets. Uh, I don't like to do those. Obviously, I said it in that video like and I'm never re-shooting that video, that's for sure. Uh, but assist mode 2 can also be used as a safety feature because as you're as you're slowing down your bar speed, it is uh giving you less weight on the next rep. And in fact, in the middle of the rep, it'll actually bring the weights down, which is just the safest way to do things. Um, and I feel like that setting should actually stick like the eccentric mode settings. So, if you turn it on, you should I honestly think there should be a setting on the machine to turn that on permanently. Like that's probably a safety feature that really should have a setting in this settings mode where we have the training preferences, right? So we have all of these and I can by the way change this back. This 1 RM setting was set to left right 1 RM se separately. I can finally change this to both both sides using them jointly again. So uh I can finally set that back. Uh but my unlimited set is set to on. There should really be use assist mode two on all exercise on all workouts and have an on button for that. I don't use it, but it should be an onoffable thing. Uh, based upon what I've seen from some other users online where they like to to have it on, but they'll forget. Um, and it doesn't stick. So, if you create a custom workout, it doesn't stick to the next workout and have assist mode on. It probably should be a setting in there to turn it on always for your particular profile. And that's one of the great things about this company. I know it sounds like I'm shilling for him when I say this, but they do make changes based upon the users feedback and they make a lot of them a lot of the time. They're they're constantly pushing out new versions of software. I have a feeling there's no progression right now at all. Um, and whatever weight you had last workout is what weight you have this workout, unless you up the the weights manually yourself. I have a feeling that's set like that because there was a bunch of feedback on the last version of the software where they were setting things too high for users. They were progressing them too quickly. Uh so they just kind of turned off the progression. The the one challenge of course of this and by the way all of these machines is they don't tell you what they did in each software update. So you get a software update and one of the it usually has like here's the big thing that we added, right? here's the big added feature of this software and here might be like a major thing that the community has been complaining about. Here's this thing and then underneath that it's just bug fixes. It's like clearly there's a massive detailed list of changes and additions and and subtractions uh that were made and they don't tell you that. And it's the same with all these digital resistance machines. Tonal doesn't either. Uh, my favorite was Tonal changed the algorithm that applies to their strength score. People want the strength score on the speeds. I actually don't want them to ever show it. Uh, I just don't because it created too much chaos within the tonal community. It sounds like a great idea to have a score that shows how strong you are. And you would think as one of the top 1% I'd be like, "Yeah, I want that score." You know, no, because people wanted the scores to be adjusted by age and that kind of stuff like age and gender and all that kind of stuff. They wanted adjusted scores then. And what you don't realize is that score is actually being used to calculate all your weights under the hood. So, if we start adjusting them and they do that incorrectly, you're going to get an absolute disaster whenever you go to lift next time. And they in fact adjusted the strength scores to fix a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes. And that meant that a whole bunch of people dropped by like 200 points overnight. So they released this new software version and boom, your score just the next time you worked out just plummeted and people got so up in arms, right? And it's all because they're showing you an internal calculation um because they they could, right? So what they have is they have your ability to lift on each individual exercise. Then they have your ability to lift within that body group. And then they have an overall calculation that is the body groups averaged into a a base calculation. And and so things derive from the base calculation, the body part specific calculation, then the work the exercise specific calculation. If you don't have an exercise specific calculation, then it guesses based upon one of the other two calculations that it has. The speediance works the same way. they just hide all those numbers, right? So, in fact, they recently changed the way they do their assessment of strength and I have not taken the new assessment. Uh, apparently people online are really not liking the new assessment and I am hesitant to do it for fear that it's going to reset all my weights and I'm in the middle of the the lunar challenge and I don't want anything to be messed with while I'm trying to do this challenge. By the way, the challenges on speeds are the funnest part. So, if we go to lunar flow, right? I'm I'm at bronze now. So, a lot of people are already at silver. They uh started the first day and then have have done it every day. I've missed a couple days and so I'm at bronze and this is working out every day on the machine, right? Which I happen to be around and able to do that and there's eight days left and I'll I'll be able to complete gold in that day. But it actually changed the way I work out in order to make that happen. So, you saw I had a dedicated arms day workout and I have a couple dedicated workouts that are much smaller than my previous workouts because they were 30 to 40,000 lb workouts and that requires a day of rest and they're full body except legs. So, my workouts used to be full body except my legs and uh and then I would end up usually needing a day of rest. Sometimes not. Sometimes I could get back in and at least do all my warm-up sets the next day. Sometimes I could do a full workout the next day. It It's not random, but it depends on recovery. It depends on training stimulus from jiu-jitsu. It it it's a lot of it's multiffactorial whether I can do another workout the next day. Well, with this Lunar Flow, I have to be able to do a workout every day of some sort. And so, this caused me to create smaller, more dedicated workouts. And I'm actually really enjoying it. And so I actually want to thank Spedians for creating these challenges because even the last challenge where it was just hit this volume uh caused me to work out harder than I normally would and crush that volume. Especially when I started to see people online posting in the speedian community that they had already hit the challenge and it's like how are you guys hitting the challenge before me? You know like people who you know don't look like I do but just get after it and work out hard. And I think that that's really important to realize that as hard as I work out, there are people who work out harder and don't have the physique I have, whether it's genetics or crossraining or whatever else goes into it, right? Um, like I shared my weight loss journey and the fact that, you know, I I have doctors that work with me to to make this happen. Like it's not just, you know, it's not it's not by random chance, right? Uh that, you know, I'm hormonally optimized. I'm as optimized as possible to make this happen. And but these people are just crushing it. I mean, there's just there's just no question. I mean, one of them's in their 60s and they beat me by I think like five, six, seven days to the last challenge where it was just a volume challenge and I'm like, man, you know, they're just incredible. So, the speed community is actually pretty cool. There's a lot of posts that are, "Hey, this thing's broken. That thing's broken." Uh, and so if you go on there and you're really fearful and then you go over to Tonal's community and say, "Hey, there's no broken anything on Tonal. Everything's perfect." Realize, "No, no, no. Speediance allows anyone to post anything." And they'll actually route those things to support from within the Speedance community. Like I imagine there's some things that could get you blocked if you're like harassing people or whatever, but like in general like if you have a problem with the device, you can go in on their Facebook group and comment what your problem is and ask other people, do they have the same problem and that kind of thing inside the Speedians community. And I can tell you Tonal won't even allow you to ask questions about their product inside their community that could be deemed negative because I ask the question of, "Hey, is there any way to remove the ad? There's a giant ad on the tonal to renew your service if you if you deactivate your membership." And I'm like, is there any way to get rid of this ad? Because it's right where your lifting your lifting stuff normally is. So you see can see the lifting stuff is always in the bottom part of the screen. Well, what Tonal does when you turn off their membership is they put the information there about reactivating your membership and move the the weightlifting information up here. And that's the only screen you can use. So there's only one screen on the entire device you can use. You can't go through create custom workouts like I just showed. I'm not paying a membership and I can create custom workouts. I can do everything. I have all the tracking stuff that's all turned off on tonal. So, I see people complaining that the speed is too expensive. Realize the tonal the five-year total cost of ownership is over $10,000 on that device. And if you turn off their membership, they uh they basically brick the device and they move your controls for the one screen that you have up to the top. So, all you have is this freelift screen. So all you can do is freelift and they move these freelift controls up to the top and put a giant ad to to bring back your membership. And I wanted the ability to turn that off because that's where I click, [laughter] you know, I I've been working with this device for over three years, clicking in the bottom to turn things on and off and change weights. Like you can still see with this one when I went to change the weight, I didn't use the ring even though I can. I can just screw the ring. I I did it on screen because instinctually, right, if you've had something for that many years, but yeah, I couldn't even ask the question. They blocked my question. So, tonal like the whole thing's curated, whereas the speed community is not. So, you'll see people post about their progressions. You'll see people post uh their problems, you'll see all kinds of stuff within their their Facebook community. So just realize if you're inside the US and you look at that community, you're looking at a set of people who have problems that need them fixed. You're looking at a set of people showing off what they've done on the machine. It's it's a it's a random assortment of things. And when you go to something like the Tonal community, you're only getting their diehard fans that are so diehard that when Tonal offered them $500 to take back the machine they paid $5,000 for um and then you don't get new access accessories at all with the new machine. So they're giving you $500 to take a machine that you paid $5,000 for and then you don't get new accessories and you basically are paying full price for the new machine. So, you're paying the full price minus $500 for the new machine, and you don't get the accessories, which are $400. So, they're literally taking your machine. They're stealing your machine. Oh, by the way, they're now reselling those machines for $3,000. So, [gasps] they took your machine and they're reselling it for 3,000 bucks and they gave you nothing. So, that that's how Tonal treats their existing customers. Uh-huh. which is why that's not on my wall anymore. Uh is that that's the experience of of being a tonal customer. I I still can't believe they're reselling them now. And I can't believe people in their community were like this is great. I get a new machine and it's like you get to pay full price for the new machine and they take your old machine like like they're also taking your old machine. Like I I get paying like if I get a Speedance 3 when it comes out, I'm going to be paying full price for the new machine, but they're not going to take my Speedians 2S and they're not going to take my original Speedance. I'll still have those machines. And by the way, the original Speedians downstairs still works great. Uh I know people ask questions. There's a lot in the community. Do I buy the 2S? Do I buy the two? Do I buy the original? I've been doing a lot of my workouts on the original and it's great. It's phenomenal for what you can see what I do in that arms workout. If we go into my arms workout. So, if we go in, sorry, that's the deadlift workout. If we go in here, my my arms workout, I'm, you know, my max weight is 80 lb, 52 lbs. This was done on the machine downstairs. 61 lb, 64 lb. Like, it's it's the weights I'm lifting are not even close to touching the max weight on the original machine, right? the the only reason why I got this one is because it's dead silent and because I wanted something that had more weight and and it's just a want. I mean, I don't do a whole lot of deadlifting. I do want to get my bench to where I can use more than the prescribed amount of weight for a lot of reps. So, I really do want to get my my bench press up this year. Uh, and eventually I'll start squatting and my squat will be above the weight. But I don't know when that'll ever or if that'll ever happen with my knees the way they are. You know, that's that's a real question mark of if I'm going to and I think if I'm going to squat, I'm going to be split squatting, which means I can't do I can't split squat over 220 pounds. And it'll be purely a range of motion thing to get my range of motion back to where it used to be. But yeah, that's my conclusion on this. Uh, I wanted to show you guys how one rep maxes work. I want to give you a little bit more insight into what I've been doing lately. The challenges, the lunar flow thing is awesome. Really changed up my game in terms of the way I lift. If you're still on the fence on buying one of these, I know people have a lot of problems. It's it's not that, you know, people don't have issues with these devices. Um, but that's that's the case with any of these smart homes. smart home devices. That's what I was telling the user online that talked about a functional trainer. They, you know, I had a functional trainer. It sat in my garage. I didn't use it. Right? That this thing gets used. I mean, it gets used nearly every day. In fact, if I go in here, let's just see where I'm at. If I go into the achievements, I'm now at um 758,000 pounds lifted since I got these machines, you know, months ago. Like if that functional trainer I didn't lift 758,000 lbs the whole time I had it. So it it just makes things so much easier. And it's not about the tracking the progression. It's about the ease of use. I go in, I tap custom, I tap the workout I want to do, and I just start lifting. That's as easy as it is. It's it's magical. And that's the way it was on Tonal, too, until I turned off the membership. And then you have to think about everything again and it becomes a functional trainer on your wall and I had tracking spreadsheets to mirror what the tonal did and even just all the data entry uh is timeconuming because I don't want to not have a log book because then I will not progress if there's no log book whatsoever. And so just having something like this that takes all of that off of my plate I think it's worth it's worth its weight in gold. And even though your functional trainer will probably last an unlimited amount of time and this realistically has a 5 to 10 year shelf life, you're only going to have this machine at most for 10 years without replacing it. So you're spending, you know, this machine was like $4,000 some dollars. You're spending $4,000 for 10 years of use at most. And the machine downstairs was $2,000. And again, you're spending $2,000 for 5 to 10 years of use. And to me, it's worth it. It's a no-brainer because it it's so much easier and the barrier of entry is so much lower to actually lifting. But you have to make that judgment call yourself on whether and and on whether or not you want to do all that tracking yourself. If you want to use a log book, if you don't mind writing things down, I don't like to write anything down on paper. So even when I had a log book, it was a digital log book and even that was too cumbersome for me. So just realize because you have to enter in the amount of reps you did because I have to see what my new one rep max capability would be. So I need to know the amount of reps I did on a particular workout on a given day to know am I progressing or not. That's like a fundamental principle of lifting. If you're not doing that, you're not making the maximum amount of progression possible. and the maximum gains possible. So realize if you don't have a log book, then you're probably not making the kind of progress you could be making. And this is a log book. So that's kind of my two cents on it. But everyone has to have their own value judgment on how much they value their money, their time, um how much they think they'll use it. Like even even when I so I had a personal trainer that did all this tracking for me and then I would go into LA Fitness before co the co shutdowns and I would track one lift at LA Fitness and then everything else was kind of sauna swim and that sort of stuff for recovery but I did actually have one lift where I was tracking that's okay because it's one lift but when you have to track 30 different lifts that becomes very cumbersome and especially Because if you're not tracking the ancillary lifts, I really think your potential to hurt yourself is much higher. So the flies that I do, all of that kind of stuff, the lateral raises, those things are what have kept me injury-free. And progressing on them has kept me injury-free. And I know I wouldn't track them with any other system other than something that's doing it on its own. Anyways, thank you for your time today. I really appreciate it. Uh like and subscribe and I'll catch you guys later.
