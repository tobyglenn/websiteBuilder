so that it's entertaining, right? Because this should be entertaining and and uh and he was doing some pretty advanced moves in po portions of it. It's not like he had some pretty unique sweeps and stuff like that. I didn't take away from this that Mike Ezel sucked, you know. I took it away that Mike and Mike Ezerell was goofing around and Greg Ducet launched on him and said, "Oh, it's taking him over three and a half minutes to take out Johnny Shre." It's like, I'm pretty sure at at Mike Ezert's skill level at that time, he could have taken him out quicker if that was the goal. But if his goal was to have an entertaining video, then that would not be the approach to make that video entertaining, especially because Johnny Shrie is big. And one of the other things Greg Ducet said is he weighs like 50 pounds more than Johnny Shre. I don't think that's true in that video. Johnny Sharief is a monster and a strong human being. Like if you put me in there with Johnny Sharie, yes, I'd be if you put me in there and put a video camera on, I would probably And I was warned that this was going to go on the internet, I would take him out in 30 seconds.

Um, but if you hit a video camera and told me to roll with Johnny Shreve and Johnny Shrieve comes in with the attitude that he seems to have, which is I'm here to have fun and learn and and like, you know, and and like don't hurt me kind of thing, right? If he has that attitude, right, and and doesn't do something to like really take me off at the beginning of the match, then I'm going to roll the same way Mike Isertel did where I'm like trying to escape from bottom and I'm trying to learn, you know, I'm trying to do a bunch of different things. Now, I probably would have tried to use some more uh fancy passes, right? Especially, you know, even not being on video, I probably would have tried to to do some more athletic things, you know, especially with someone that big, you know, it might be time to bust out a cartwheel guard pass. Bust it out like once a year when I have to. I do have the ability to do those. I do not like doing them, especially not like right now I'm pushing 220 pounds. That's not the time for me to cart real guard pass, but I definitely can. Um, it's just one of those things where he was using he was using some techniques where you could definitely draw criticism that it wasn't the latest and greatest and fanciest jiu-jitsu in in all of those
