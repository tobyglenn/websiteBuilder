And my justification for buying two speeds is at the end of the day to replace the tonal is the tonal two total cost of ownership is actually more expensive than buying both of these devices. Which is absolutely crazy to think about the math on that. That you can buy two devices, have one in your office, one in your living room, and still be money ahead of buying a total and advertising it over five years. um for the for the life expectancy of the device which I think is about where I got with the tonal is about five years before I bought these guys in total. Um maybe four years, something like that.
