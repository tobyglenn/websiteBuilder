problem. Anyways, watch what happens whenever I end my set. So, I'm in here. By the way, I can only do this because these are my warm-up sets. I would I would be breathing so heavy and grunting and and and it would not look good in my actual working sets. I would not be able to do this and talk during it. So, let's just say I do two extra reps and then I'm going to finish it. I go up. The weight's still on. The weight was on the whole time, guys. I never had the weight back off. That's right. I brought the whole way up to the machine without the weight ever turning off. If you can't do that in your warm-up sets, you're not doing warm-up sets. You're doing working sets, right? And by the way, for working sets, sometimes I can't bring them the whole way off. I have to sit there and pause with them until it turns them off. And the real question is, what if it didn't turn off automatically? Like, what if I was one of those people? Uh, there was one person online where it didn't turn off automatically and they say it hurt them. Well, you know what I'm going to do? I'm not going to sit there and wait forever and let it hurt me, right? Realize it's never done this. What what that person posts about my machine. I have two machines lifted over a million pounds. It's never done what they were saying it did. So, I just want to make that clear. It has never happened, right? And honestly, if if it would happen, it would concern me and you guys would know about it. So, it's never not turned off the weight for me at the end of my set. I could see it happening with a software glitch. You know what I mean? It's not surprising that it happened to that person, but it's never happened to me. Anyways, what I would do, I just let go of them. You know, that person was like, they were in a position where they could have just dropped the bar. So, they were squatting and they could have just dropped it off their back, right? And they're like, "Well, I didn't want to hurt the machine." I'm like, "Okay, instead you break your spine." Like, what are you thinking? Like I don't care about this machine when it com compares to my spine or my shoulders. Like I'm just going to let go of the handle and let it fly back and and hit hit the machine. These things are rubber padded. I mean these are way way better protected than the tonals were. So, like you couldn't do this on tonal where you just let it go that the the whole screen what I just did there where I let the thing go, right? The tonal would be flipping out at me because it does not want because the way these pieces connect, at least the tonal one, and it's probably the same for the tonal 2. They didn't do much. I think they changed the material. They they they actually changed it, I think, from a plastic to a metal, right? But it's still plastic on metal, which means instead of instead of uh like you're going to damage this piece, right? This is metal, rubber, metal, right? Like it's it's the safest mechanism for being able to do that. I'm not saying the build quality on this machine is better than the tonals in every way, but I'm saying in this particular way, it it definitely like it's not throwing errors on my screen because it's not going to hurt them. And if that person had dropped their barbell, I mean, worst case scenario, it it it breaks. It wouldn't even break this thing. They would have been fine. They would have been fine. Like, they could have just dropped it. Like, I'm I'm pretty confident they could have just thrown that thing off their back, let it retracted, and and hit, you know, at the bottom of the thing, and they would have been fine. So, not to be mean to a user who posted a legitimate safety concern, but it's one of those things where I always value my body over breaking the machine, and I recommend anyone do that. So, yeah. In conclusion, I don't think Safety Start is something we should be using. I'm I'm so disappointed that they haven't brought us uh partner workouts in custom workouts, and they didn't actually bring back partner mode and freelift the way it was before, which was already broken. So, it's like you didn't actually bring back the thing. It's not new, revised, and enhanced. It's It's worse. It's definitively worse than the old Freelift mode. You know, I only gripe about that because when the V3.1 Oh, they are doing a much better job of telling you what's in each software update. So, they they used to be notorious for the bug fixes as the as the it's like what did you change, right? They're doing a way So, they are listening to the community. They they brought back freelift mode in some fashion or freelift partner workout mode in some fashion in two weeks which you you normally never see from a big business like that to be able to even bring it back in some fashion. And uh so you know in some ways I'm critical because they're not giving me the feature I want and they're giving me features I definitively don't want. Uh and I think most of the user community shouldn't want it. that person who was using safety star for every single one of their sets. They're either doing all top sets, right? Which, hey, more power to you if you can do, you know, first of all, I don't think you can. I don't think, you know, you know, from a a logistic, you're going to hurt yourself. And especially, you're going to hurt yourself because you're limiting your range of motion on every single exercise you're doing. So, you're limiting your range of motion and you're doing top sets on every single exercise you're doing. That's a recipe. That is how I injured myself. Essentially, what they're describing, they're turning this into something that could make you way more injuryprone than what it is. Like the reason why I espouse these machines is specifically for that retraction, for bringing it back under high eentric load and keeping the joint safe because that means that what's going on with this machine is I'm able to make it so that I'm limiting my strength growth in the concentric um phase and accelerating the eccentric, which is the the phase where typically you would you would tear stuff. So people don't tear stuff in their concentric phase. They tear it in their eccentric phase typically or at least me, right? Maybe I should just speak for myself. That's where all my injuries happen on free weights is whenever it is not when I'm pushing it up, but whenever it's coming back down, something tears, right? And that's because um it's because your pushing power was way more than my stabilizing power, right? And so it would or it would be when I'm about to hit the concentric phase. So by having the concentric eliminating and the eccentric loading at a higher weight, I'm always making sure that I stretch everything and actually kind of fix all of those issues. I find that way of lifting and to use safety start means I'm limiting that. And and to to be more specific, why people were very happy about safety start was a bug in the machine that I think they fixed for everything but unilateral movements. So, I've already seen it with V3.1 where I actually have the setting. So, there's a setting on this machine that is supposed to fix this and I actually already did a post about it. So, like hopefully it's on the dev team's radar because I said specifically that my setting is set like that. So, if you go into settings, right, there is a setting under I believe it's training preferences. So, settings, training preferences, and then there is a a setting on here called 1RM setting, and it's both both sides jointly on the latest 1RM. Okay, that means that the left and right side won't get different weights, except they have a massive bug. They've had it forever. it it goes away for like a release every now and then and then it comes back where it will decide you've PRD on one side and give you a totally different weight and I've seen it and I wish I had screenshotted it um to send over to the dev team just so that they can like actually troubleshoot this in a real world scenario because what's happening is it thinks that you PR on side one and then it's applying a new weight to side two but unlike everywhere else where they prompt you it looks like there's a bug still in this version of the software where it doesn't prompt you. It gives you the new PR weight and then it threw me into the machine. Well, it didn't quite throw me into the machine, but it gave me a weight that was the problem with it is because I'm using eccentric mode. If if I if I were to select its default setting, which is the most agre like aggressive at at giving you a new higher weight, um you know, so the default setting is a very aggressive weight, which was like 10 lbs added and 10 lbs plus like that's a lot of weight, you know, basically. And so it I it was almost on on so I was doing you know like a high to low cable fly and it was it was so much weight that I couldn't even like so I start them here and I went to pull it and I'm like I can't even pull this. And then it dawned on me to actually check and look and see what the last weight was. So I'll show you that just so that I can give you an idea of how you can look at these things on the machine because you can actually track this. And I'm pretty sure I do have a Yeah, here's a whole one arm uh workout. So, we can show it here. So, what happens is when you do one side versus the other, there is this. So, at the top of the screen, there's a button that has like four uh four rectangles. So, it's music controls, four rectangles, power, right? The four rectangles button uh has screen rotation, move analysis, and move playlist. The thing you want is the move analysis for this. Okay, for this in particular, uh, and maybe I'm wrong. I am wrong. The thing you want for this is move playlist. So, um, move analysis is actually the one that you use. By the way, I usually mess this up at least once whenever I'm working out. So, the move analysis is the thing that you use to figure out where it goes where where your um where your connection points go into the machine. So this move analysis tells you this is the piece that matters. And you notice that piece is past the scroll. So that's why this is really frustrating. And one user was like, if you guys are going to do a new UI and do an extensive overhaul, put this information on this screen. What I'm saying is put the information of what level this thing is supposed to be at on the actual screen because this is one thing where I'm like, "Huh, why did I never have a problem with having to do three clicks on the tonal to figure out uh to figure out, you know, where these things should go?" And you'd think I'd know by now because I do the same workouts over and over again, but I forget like because there's so many different adjustment levels, which is a plus, right? Not complaining about having all of these different placements. I forget whether it's L4 or L5, right? And it bothers me that I won't have it at the right point. And sometimes, like here, you can't see like you can't see. Well, you can see because he's at the platform bottom, but when it's in the front view, if it was if it was on the uh on on the speedian itself, you wouldn't be able to see, right? And so some of the videos, you have to kind of sit here and wait and wait and wait until you get a clear shot of the side to actually see which level they're at. And that's too much time. It's actually easier to hit the three buttons, the move analysis, and scroll. Like, believe it or not, that's actually faster sometimes than waiting on the video and hoping that you get a clear shot of the side rail, right? You can see this was a two camera shoot, by the way. So, they're upgrading all of his moves, right? That's what I was complaining about yet last time where uh his moves were all one camera originally, and now this one's two camera, right? All of the female uh Spanish speaking ladies moves are all three camera, so you get three different angles of the move. like you would have gotten an overhead shot to be able to see better activation. This one's actually pretty good though. I mean, you can see the activation in his muscles, which is pretty rare actually for a lot of his lifts. Um, I wonder if he actually doesn't have it to the minimum setting on this. I wish I could see. Uh, he has it on. Yeah, he does not. I don't think he has that on the minimum setting for so maybe he's also going through and fixing that whenever they do the updated videos because he was using the minimum setting and with it big and as strong as he is like he he gets no muscle activation so you can't see the target muscles which actually really really matters to me. I don't know why it matters to me because I'm this is how I work out by the way. It's muted right now. So that is actually how I do my real workouts with it muted. So, I didn't realize that the Spanish speakaking lady was speaking Spanish until until someone pointed out to me and then I I listened to it. I'm like, "Oh, yeah, she is speaking." But they're massively like they're always upgrading. That's what blows my mind about the speed. It's like I can complain about the V3 software being, you know, trash. I mean, let's just call it what it is. Like I think all of these things are actually other than the the UX down here is much cleaner and prettier and more effective for what I do where I max the eccentric, it's so much faster to spin the eentric to max whenever I create new workouts because realize when you create new workouts, every time you initially create a new custom workout, if you want max eccentric, you have to go and apply it to every single exercise individually after the creation of the workout and then it sticks and saves it. So it's not a big deal because it saves it after the fact. If I had to do it every time, I would have returned the original speed. Like to be honest with you, if I had to reset that every time to be max eccentric, the original speedings would have gotten returned. There would be no speeding. But it sticks the setting. And so that's it's like someone asked for it to be on the other screen and it's like, dude, it sticks the setting. You didn't actually do your workout twice. Like if you do your workout a second time, it remembers it. You know what I mean? like you didn't actually and some people jump the gun with these questions because the machine doesn't explain any of this, right? It's not their fault, right? When they're asking these questions that are like so basic to answer, right, because the machine doesn't explain any of this and they're constantly iterating and changing. So, that could change in the future. I could see it being on that on that menu and and you know, in a future update. It's just, you know, what the speedian team kind of prioritizes. My opinion, prioritize uh bringing uh partner mode into everything in your ecos. That's my opinion. That should be your number one priority. If I'm giving priorities, that's your number one priority. Pilates actually gets shelfd to make that happen. Like, you know, shelf everything that I realize they're not going to do that. They're launching Pilates soon, if not already. But that that would be my priority. Even believe it or not, bringing partner workouts to custom workouts, I would want above fixing this retraction issue. So, this retraction issue is an issue that could cause harm to the device. And I would still rather have partner mode inside custom workouts and across the board to where my wife can log in and we can do a workout together that I've created. Right? That that's I mean that's paramount to me in my opinion. Right? for now. She just works out by herself. You know, that is what it is. But I would like to be able to work out with it, right? I I I just think it'd be much better. And when we did their workouts, I hated them so much that cuz it's not the way I train. I train with a whole bunch of warm-up sets, make sure my body can handle it, then I train with my working sets. And that's not how they train. They do a couple BS warm-ups, and then they throw you into sets, you know, and and that's that's how the tonal was, too. So, I'm not criticizing like this is different than the tonal. Tonal's had more warm-up sometimes, but it still was not an adequate warm-up for someone who is as injuryprone as, you know, I'm almost 40. I'm not getting any younger by day. Um, and I can lift some seriously heavy weight, but can I lift that weight every day? No. you know, it's varying on how much sleep did I get, how much time am I spending with the kids, how how you know what we've been doing lately, like uh how much my nutrition's on point. Uh, so everything matters to whether I can lift a heavy weight that and I want to know that ahead of time by the time I get there with a whole bunch
