This is why don't ever use the customize option. Don't touch that option. Like I'm just going to be blunt. Don't touch it because you're going to break stuff because it's going to reset some of these values and reset it across all of your exercises. Right? So if you do custom give it a particular weight, don't turn on a centric mode then all of the sudden or back something off in a different way than you would normally. that is not it's no longer going to have these values the way it would normally. So if I go in here, I do this. So I've got 13 reps. The only difference between the way I used to work out is I used to do 12 reps. So now I have 13 reps. Now I forgot to turn these handles on ahead of time. So you will see one of them clicked on. And you can see did the second one finally click on? Yes. So, the second one clicked on but did not make the sound for me. So, you can see why I start them up ahead of time. If you start them up about 30 seconds ahead of time, they'll always be connected. So, I'm going in here. I'm doing my warm-up set. I don't care as much about the form in the warm-up set. All I care about is really getting it done and moving on. I do a bunch of these in a row in my actual workouts, but just to show you, I'm going in here doing 13 reps. And this is heavy enough that I can feel it. I never do extra reps on these. So on my warm-up sets, I don't ever do extra reps. When it dings, I stop. What I'm doing here is I'm pre working the muscle. That was heavy enough for me to feel it, but not heavy enough that I cannot breathe afterwards. You notice I'm talking fine. I'm talking like nothing ever happened. That is the power of again those settings of 20 and 13. So, what I'm doing is setting it to 20 as my amount of reps to to where So, that would be if it was 20 and 20, that would be my one rep max at at 20 at 20 reps. But because it's 20 and 13, I'm actually way further away from my one rep max. That's how you have to think about it. And every time I go in there, I have to figure out which one is which. And it's very easy because the one that's reps is the amount of reps you're doing. You want that to be the lowest number. So, and for stamina in particular, you like I always want it to be 13. I would like it to be 12, but it won't give me 12. So, it gets 13. I'm doing an extra rep. Oh no, I'm, you know, getting a little bit fitter, you know. But you can see this one, it immediately jumped it up to 29 and 14. So, again, the eccentric is maxed out. The weight is much heavier and I still have 13 reps to
