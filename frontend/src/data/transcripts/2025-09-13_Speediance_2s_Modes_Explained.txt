Welcome to Tobio and Fitness Tech. I figured I would go through and make a quick simplified video talking about the specifics of this machine, the Speedance, and the actual modes that it has within automatically setting your weights because it seems like there's a lot of questions around that. Uh I did get a very specific question and I'll put the question down below here uh so that you can see the full question but I'm going to start by answering the second part of the question and I'll explain why I'm doing that as I'm answering the second part of the question. So the second part of the question was basically around when you go in and do a custom workout. Um, so I go in, I do a custom work. Let's just say add freely custom. Add movements. Pick a random movement that has some kind of an attachment. Right? So we go here, we add this. So now we are presented with this screen where it's the new customization screen. And if you can't see it, I will actually put a picture of this now down below and show you what's actually on my screen so you can see it in clear detail the exact modes that are here. And this is where people get very confused and honestly it is confusing. So that's why I wanted to make it a separate video from all of my other videos and just talk about this because and and also explain why I have to answer the second part of the question first because in here we have these preset training modes gain muscle stamina strength and custom and inside here we have the dynamic weight modes standard chain and eccentric. What what these three modes do outside of customize is they go in and use the dynamic weights based on your strength assessment and PR values. And why I say strength assessment and PR values is if you have PR values for that individual mo movement, it will use those. If it doesn't have a PR value for that individual movement, it will use your strength assessment. And there was another posting online where someone had went in here, used customize, and set their set their weight to 10 pounds for dumbbell curls. They were specifically doing dumbbell curls. They set it to 10 pounds and they wanted that to be their warm-up. Then they went into their dynamic mode. and after that added the dumbbell curls at the weight that they want at at the dynamic weight expecting them to get 10 lbs in their warm-up and then 33 lbs in their working sets. What the machine actually did is set their working sets to 10 pounds. Now, I don't know something and the person didn't answer me on did they do the strength assessment first. So, I don't know the answer to that, but if they did the strength assessment first and then the customized 10 pounds, it decided that that was your new PR value. That seems like a software glitch to me. And the Speedian team themselves actually reached out to this user. I don't know because that's all usually once the speediance team reaches out to you they do everything through DMs by the way and they talk directly to you which is pretty awesome uh to try to resolve your issue and what I don't know from this user is did they do the strength assessment first because if the answer is no then what happened is they went into customize they entered in 10 10 pounds for their weight and then it thought that that was their PR value and then used 10 pounds as their new PR value. Now, this could all be avoided by doing what I talked about in the previous video where what I'm going to do is I'm going to go in here and pick stamina and then I'm going to set my weight to or sorry, I'm going to set my yes, I'm going to set my weight to 15 and I'm going to set my training to to sorry, I'm gonna set my weight. I'm going to set my weight to 20 and my training to 15. So, weight's going to be set to 20. It's messing me up to have all these here. So, my weight's going to be set to 20 and my training is going to be set to 15. I'll put a picture of that down below so that you can see exactly what that looks like, too. What I'm doing here is I'm superficially using stamina mode to give me a value that is way lower than my 1RM capability and that will actually give me a warm-up set. So I would avoid this customize altogether for warm-up sets especially based on that person's posting. And this will give you a warm-up set because what you're doing is, and this is where it gets very, very weird, what you're actually doing in here is you're setting your value that you're going to lift to 20 reps of that 1 RM value, and you're actually only doing 15 of them. The machine will not reset your PRs. In this case, it will say this is not your PR capability. You're intentionally doing this. My fear with customize based upon what this user showed online is that customize is actually resetting your 1RM value when it shouldn't. And I can't explain that. And I'm not sure if that is always happening or only happening to that user. My guess is it only happened to this user. And my guess is it happened to this user because they didn't do the strength score ahead of time. So it didn't have a true oner RM northstar to set you to and it thought that 10 was his strength which is obviously not their strength, right? They just wanted a light set for their initial set. This would give them that light set because if you think about it, if their working weight is 33 for 10, let's just say their working weight was 33 for 10. That was their working weight. This would be about 12 13 pounds, which is probably a better weight for them anyways. They they probably should not be using 10. They should be using something a little heavier, but not, you know, not 20, right? It shouldn't be like that heavy, but this would give them probably around 13 14 pounds. Uh, if I actually go in and do I can tell you if I add a freely custom, we'll actually do this really quick. We'll go in and make it curls as the name. And I'll actually show you what I'm talking about. Add. And then we'll go to uh curls. curl, right? Seated leg, barbell, standing. I just search for curl. Hopefully, it will pick the curl that I want. Supine standing. Oh my gosh, so many curl options. That is one thing with this machine. There is not very many missing exercises. So my critique of tonal was always it didn't have the exercises you want. The critique of this one is it's hard to find some of the exercises because because it has everything you could ever want, which is a much better It's easier to do in the app. So I should have probably preloaded this, but here we go. Standing single arm bicep curls. Ah, here's the dual handle. The dual handle is what I actually want for this. So, I'm going to add it. Right. I'm going to close out all these extra sets. I'm going to set my rest to 45 seconds or 30. I can set it to 30 if I switch it to stamina. So, switch it to stamina. Close out of all these other sets because I only need one set of warm-up. I set this to 30. I set my weight to 20. And I set my reps to the lowest amount volume possible, which is 13. So, I'm setting reps to 13, weight to 20. Right? Then I'm going to move my bench out of the way so you guys can see this. I'm going to add another movement. But instead of adding another movement this way, I will show you another button down at the bottom. Uh there's a sequence option. So, I'm going to click this sequence option. And I'll tell you why I'm going to click this. Because whenever I click the sequence option, I can click add and it will add the exact exercise and it'll put it in the next sequence and then I close. So this is a way faster way of getting one more set, but it'll be and this is why I'm using stamina for everything now because literally I could just add my next set of my actual working set and then change these values to be the exact opposite 15 and leave it at 13 actually. So, it's going to be 203 1513. And now I'm going to save. And then here it'll show me my weights. So, I'm going to put the screenshot at the bottom of the screen for you. Now, uh I'm going to start out at 22 and then I'm going to go up to 29. And the one other change that I want to make on this real quick is I want to change the weight mode to eentric. And you'll see one other thing whenever I go in here and I hit start. So now this thing shows as a pin wheel. And that's important because you can actually see in the program workouts which mode they're using at a quick glance. So when I hit start on this, I got 22 lbs with 11 eccentric. And it maxed the eentric out. Now why did it max the eentric out? That's not how this comes by default. Well, the answer is it maxed the eccentric eccentric out because that's actually where I have it in all of my other workouts is maxed out, which is really cool about the machine. So, once you've created once you've used a movement and you've done it in a particular way, it remembers that throughout all of time. This is why don't ever use the customize option. Don't touch that option. Like, I'm just going to be blunt. Don't touch it because you're gonna break stuff because it's going to reset some of these values and reset it across all of your exercises, right? So, if you do custom give it a particular weight, don't turn on eentric mode, then all of a sudden or back something off in a different way than you would normally, that is not it's no longer going to have these values the way it would normally. So, if I go in here, I do this. So, I've got 13 reps. The only difference between the way I used to work out is I used to do 12 reps. So now I have 13 reps. Now I forgot to turn these handles on ahead of time. So you will see one of them clicked on. And you can see, did the second one finally click on? >> Yes. So, the second one clicked on but did not make the sound for me. So, you can see why I start them up ahead of time. If you start them up about 30 seconds ahead of time, they'll always be connected. So, I'm going in here. I'm doing my warm-up set. I don't care as much about the form in the warm-up set. All I care about is really getting it done and moving on. I do a bunch of these in a row in my actual workouts. But just to show you, I'm going in here, doing 13 reps. And this is heavy enough that I can feel it. I never do extra reps on these. So on my warm-up sets, I don't ever do extra reps. When it dings, I stop. What I'm doing here is I'm pre working the muscle that was heavy enough for me to feel it, but not heavy enough that I cannot breathe afterwards. You notice I'm talking fine. I'm talking like nothing ever happened. That is the power of again those settings of 20 and 13. So, what I'm doing is setting it to 20 as my amount of reps to to where So, that would be if it was 20 and 20, that would be my one rep max at at 20 at 20 reps. But because it's 20 and 13, I'm actually way further away from my one rep max. That's how you have to think about it. And every time I go in there, I have to figure out which one is which. And it's very easy because the one that's reps is the amount of reps you're doing. You want that to be the lowest number. So, and for stamina in particular, you like I always want it to be 13. I would like it to be 12, but it won't give me 12. So, it gets 13. I'm doing an extra rep. Oh, no. I'm, you know, getting a little bit fitter, you know. But you can see this one, it immediately jumped it up to 29 and 14. So, again, the eentric is maxed out. The weight is much heavier, and I still have 13 reps to do. So I have an extra five pounds plus an extra three pounds of eccentric. So I have additional weight that I have to lift. And this is now this is the the one where I I usually do it a little slower. So what'll happen is I'll turn on the weight. I'll come up. I'll come down. And now the eentric kicked in. So I'm up right here. The eentric kicked in. Up right here. The eentric kicked in. up right here. The eentric kicked in. The reason why I'm saying it that way is a ton of what kicks in up here. So, I can't pause up here, but here I can pause for a little bit and wait up there. Right? It's it's a difference of the way the machine works. This feels a little bit safer to have me back off a little bit before it kicks in. Okay. So, that should actually, if I did it right, and it's not going to show you. Of course, it's not going to show you, but that actually should have been a new 1RM because I did 16 with a 151RM. The way I'll confirm that after the fact. So, if I go down here, 13 of 13 here, 16 of 13. My one rep max is 45. [Music] No, it did not hit the 1 RM. It must have been pretty close. So, that's shocking that it didn't hit the 1 RM, but my guess is because the eentrics is maxed out like that, it's not going to hit the 1 RM like it would normally. I have hit some 1 RMS on different exercises, including this one, but that just must have been a little bit under the threshold, but I should have been close because I did 16 with a 15 one RM. That should put me in theory one rep ahead of my one rep max. But I've noticed with this machine every now and then it's not quite you haven't quite done enough wraps if that makes any sense. Especially with these dual handle movements because I messed some of them up by um by doing one arm more than the other arm when I first got it. So a couple of these exercises have a little bit of uh nuance. But the other part of this person's question, so how does it affect the programs and the actual workouts? So if we go in here and do a regular workout and let's pick something that is on the machine. So uh that's a cardio workout. Sorry. Let me go into something that's an a real level populate or push they move things around. So we want Let's just pick this one. Actually, let's pick this one. Okay. So, in here, what what it'll show you is it's going to show you the different exercises is that it's going to do. And these are all the warm-ups. So, this actually has warm-up call outs. And then whenever it goes into training, that's whenever it's these warm-ups. It looks like these are presets by the like it's presetting it to 8 pounds which is the minimum it's the minimum amount. So my theory is that these presets are actually to specific weights and then once you've gotten past those presets where it's highlighting them with warm-ups then it's actually using your strength scores from from from your work from your custom workouts. So everything from your custom workouts will flow back into this because it st th throws it into your onerm for that particular movement. So what'll happen is each movement has a 1 RM value and then that movement will um that movement will actually cause these scores to be updated. So they're all connected. So, if you mess up and get 10 for your bicep curl, it's going to be 10 across all of these as your one rep max. The the quick fix for that is to jump up your weight um is to jump up your weight when you're in one of these three presets that I was talking about or in your actual workout. So, if you're in one of their workouts, just jump up your weight to what you want it to be and then do the reps and it'll reset your your max. So, the solution to this person, they did their 10ens and then they wanted the next to be 33. The solution is to jump the weight up one time to 33 and then it should remember that for all of your working sets. But my fear is when they go back in with that same custom workout, they're then reoverriding it to 10 with their warm-up sets. That's why I'm talking specifically around using the stamina mode to get dynamic warm-up sets. And that's what I was trying to explain in the other video, but I don't think I explained it fully that that's giving you a dynamic workup set based on your one rep max. these warm-ups that are on their workouts from what I can see. They're just setting things when they say warmup, they're just setting things to the minimum weight. Let me see if I can do other all workouts and just confirm that with a couple other ones. So, if I go all-incclusive full body, here we go. Yes. So, this warmup, yeah, these are timed and then it goes right into training. So, my theory is all of their warm-ups. So, that was timed and not an actual on on expedience exercise. And let's see. I'm pretty sure all of these that I've seen my wife do. So, my wife only uses, by the way, full disclosure, my wife only uses the preset workouts and I only use my custom workouts. So, in this situation, I actually get to see both things. I'm always doing my custom workouts. She's always doing the presets on here, and we're both getting stronger with the same technology behind the scenes because it's all based on your one rep max for that movement. If you're not at an adequate one rep max, you set the weight higher one time and then do that set and it'll remember that that is your new max that you can lift. or in my case with the eentric modes cranked way up to max. I had to actually back the weights off because I did the strength assessment. The strength assessment doesn't have eentric mode on any of those lifts on at all. And that totally changes the amount that you can lift. When that eentric mode is putting 14 extra pounds down, I can't lift as much in the up position. And you're thinking, why would I want to do that? Why would I want to waste that ability to lift up with maximal force? Well, because I'm not a strength athlete and I want to work my tricep and my bicep all in one movement because I realize I'm not going to do tricep isolation exercises. And I want to work the full arm with one bicep curl. And that's what I'm doing. I'm going up and then I'm resisting it down. And you can actually feel the tension like I can feel the tension in the back of this muscle. And that's how I built triceps because I don't do any tricep workouts except a couple that I was doing uh because they helped relieve my back tension. So I I would do some tricep like tricep pull down style stuff, but that's more to work on my motion in my shoulders and fix the back and shoulder issues, the upper back and shoulder issues that jiu-jitsu will cause. Sometimes I will pick exercise specifically because I notice relief from uh tension that I get in jiu-jitsu and especially in the case of if I'm not feeling it. The one benefit of the way I work out and this has been a huge saver to my ability to even do these workouts is if I look at my workout out once I've moved it over I have all of these warm-up sets that come first. So all of my sets say training. None of them say warm up. And all of these training sets, these are actually 13 reps at 20 RM. So all of these, the first set are at 20 RM. And it's not until I get to exercise, let's see, two, four, it's probably 10 exercises in that I hit my 15 RM sets. And that, by the way, is actually the first exercise. So, what I do is I bang all of these out as as many of them I can, three or four of them in a row, and then I do three or four of them in a row, and then I get into the training sets, and then it's one rest, five minutes, one rest, five minutes, one rest, five minutes. So, it becomes very time consuming once I get into the actual meat and potatoes of the workout. But all of those warm-up sets are just to assess how my body is feeling today. And if I get to the very end of those warm-up sets and I'm not feeling it, I just call the workout right there and I've lifted 10,000 pounds. So, I've lifted almost 10,000 pounds and I haven't even begun my real workout and I'm adding volume and it's not junk volume because it's help helping relieve tension in my muscles and relieve tightness and soreness. So, whenever I go to hit that workout the next day, I'm not I still do the warm-ups, but I can do them much more quickly and then get into the working sets. You'll find some days I have a hard time with just the warm-ups, and other days I I flow through these warm-ups and then can get into the working sets pretty easily. It just depends on how my body's feeling. I think that's really important to listen to your body. And that's why I really am a big fan of the stamina setting for everything that I do now. And I never thought stamina would be the one that I used. I figured it would be the gain muscle setting because I'm used to doing 12 rep sets, but that would be the worst for me because there's no way to set that high enough to get warm-up sets. Because when you go in and do these, so when you go in and do gain muscle, your values that you have available to you are 12 reps and 13 RM. That means I have to be one. My minimum option is one rep away from failure. Like your minimum option is one rep away from failure in this setting. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, especially if you have a lot of time to enter your workouts. If you have a ton of time to enter what you want to do for my work, for my actual working sets, I would rather set it to 12 and 13 and be one, one rep from failure and I'll do 14 like you saw today. I did 16 with the bicep curls when I was set to 15. That puts me at my 1RM or a little bit above it in theory, but not enough for it to give me a new max high score. What I'm getting at here is these values are highly important and and I like that stamina setting only because then I'm also doing the same amount of reps throughout my workout. I'm very specific about that. Okay, that's all I had for this video. I wanted to try to make it a little bit more brief than some of my longer videos. I'm going to put the video I'm going to put some of the pictures below so that it explains it in more detail. And I think this will give you a better understanding of I would not recommend using this customize at all from the horror stories that I've seen of people online where the customiz is now setting their 1RM values and because it and also when you're adjusting the weights sometimes the better approach if you don't have to adjust it over 3 4 lb. Like if you're adjusting things 3 to four lb, like 3 to four lbs up or 3 to four lb down, I really recommend trying to if it's 4 lbs down, try to do the set first. And if you fail at the set, like if you fail at 12 reps instead of 13, this machine, even when I went to fail at 12 sets, 12 12 reps, sorry, it didn't turn itself. The tonal would turn itself off. If you fail at 12 reps, it'll turn it off and skip skip you over to your next set. It's like you're done. This machine will give you the opportunity to do the extra rep. Now that I have neither of the um uh what do they call it? I have neither of the assist modes on. So there's two assist modes. I'm actually going to cover those in a separate video coming up shortly, but I wanted to make this one first because it was a question to me from someone on YouTube. And I think it's honestly the most important thing to learn about this machine is these weight settings, this gain muscle, stamina, strength, and also how they flow through to your program. It's basically they're just taking these values, extracting them out, putting them into the individual exercises themselves, and then bringing them into the programs. As long as in the program it's saying the word training, which they nearly always do for things that are on device. And it looks like anything that's on device that is labeled warm-up is setting it to the minimum weight and ignoring that from the one 1RM calculations. I hope that kind of explains this in more detail. I hope it's more clear because it it definitely was confusing to me and it's still confusing when you come in here what these values mean. It's not the the most understandable way to do it. It's it's very understandable if you learn about one rep maxes and that kind of thing, but it's it's not easy to figure out. It would actually be easier in my opinion if this machine didn't have these three presets and just had you fill in these two values, but gave you more guidance around what these values mean and also probably flip them. So, it should be dynamic weight here and then how many reps do you want to do? And it shouldn't say training. It should say how many reps do you want to do, right? In a big long thing without this reps without this reps button because the reps button Oh, that's why they have it. Sorry. Because they do have the seconds option. So, that's why they have that as a button. I was wondering. I haven't even I hadn't clicked on this to see the fact that they have a seconds option, which makes sense because in some of their training they set it to seconds for their warm-ups. So, it looks like you can do as many you can actually do 60 seconds here and then you can do 13 RM. And what that 13 RM is going to do is set it to a uh what is your one rep max at 13 reps? So your one rep max itself is the maximum amount of weight you can lift. So say for me that on bench that's 245 pounds, right? Uh off the device on the device I can't even bench 200. So off the device my one rep max is 245 pounds. That's for one. Whenever you get into 13, my one rep max for 13 is probably going to be 170 lbs. You see how it escalates downward, but it doesn't escalate downward in a linear curve. It's actually more of a jagged curved by the amount of reps. It's not directly linear. And as you go as you go higher and higher with the reps, you go lower and lower with the weights. And so what it's doing is it has a one rep max calculation. When I went over to my custom spreadsheets that I was using, I was using tonal's exact values that they have their multipliers for each one for how much that is of your one rep max. So everyone everything's calculated from the highest one rep max individual weight you can lift and then it's calculating down from there. And then what happens is when I hit a new one rep max, I'm not hitting a new one rep max of my actual one rep max. I'm hitting my new one rep max of that calculated one rep max and it's plugging it back into the original one rep max. That might have sounded wildly confusing, but what it means in layman's term is that 16, even though it should have been a one rep max by your conventional thought of, oh yeah, that was one more than 15, so 16, it should be a new one rep, when it plugged back into my weight, it was probably almost exactly the same or rounding error up. It wasn't a whole pound above my original max at one rep. And that's why it didn't give me the new score. And in fact, I've sold that. I sold that in my spreadsheets where I've done 16 reps or in my case, it would be 13 reps because I was doing 12 reps. So I would I had done 13 reps. I plugged it back into my original value and I had it this all automated. But whenever it plugged itself back into the original one rep max, it was, you know, 6 or 7, which I round everything down. I I I so I had it all round down, which this machine probably rounds down two because it's safer. So I'm rounding down. So if I don't get a whole one pound more, I round it down if that makes sense. So it has to be it would have to be in my case, I would have had to do 14 reps to get that new one in because I needed it to be over one. And then once I get over one, if even if it's 1.7, I only add the one pound because I'm rounding it down. That was just for safety purposes. And I don't know what the exact calculation looks like behind the scenes on this machine, but I would guess it's similar to the way I did my spreadsheets. And that's why my 16 at 15 didn't hit a a new 1 RM. Wanted to show you the 1 RM. That was why I did an an extra rep. But it's actually more important that I didn't hit that one RM because it shows that there's a rounding factor. And this isn't this isn't as easy as just taking that value and that's your 1 RM. No, no, no. It's that's your 1 RM at that amount of reps. And that's why this screen is so complicated. Let's go back into reps. But that's why the screen is so complicated. And it's 8 to 12 reps at 13 RM. Okay, that's all I have for you today. Thank you for listening to my channel. I appreciate any likes, subscribes. I appreciate if you've listened through this for. If you have if you have any questions, put them in the comments below. That's really helpful for me to figure out what I need to expound upon more. I'll continue talking about the speedience, especially because I have one more video already that I want to make based upon something else someone said uh where they need to use the ring to dial up and down the weights uh during their set to do drop sets. And I want to show how I think drop sets should work on this device, but I'm not sure if that's actually how they'll work. So, we'll be testing it live to see the drop to see if I can recreate drop sets on this device and see how it behaves. And that's specifically with those smart assist features. Okay, that's all for today though. Thank you for your time.
