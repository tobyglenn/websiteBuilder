Is it quiet? So, this is in standby mode and it's dead silent. So, there is no noise coming out of this Speedance 2S at all in standby mode. I was shocked. I thought it was not actually on because that's not the experience of the original Speedance Gym Monster. Uh, so I was, you know, very shocked that this power supply makes no noise in standby mode. And that's incredible to me. And then when you actually turn it on, you will hear a slight noise. And I'll pause for a second and I'll pipe in the audio of the noise that it makes when it's on. So that's the noise that it makes. And in my opinion, that noise is perfect for in my office because I already have an air purifier up there. And this noise is quieter than the air purifier's noise. It's about equivalent to somewhere between low and medium on the fans that I have above me.
