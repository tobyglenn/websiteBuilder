But the answer is actually it depends. And that's why I wanted to make it into a little bit of a more long form video and explain that the training that I did to get the physique that I have today is actually not the training that I do today. If that makes any sense. So in when I was actually building this physique whenever I was going from uh morbidly obese to fit right and I did it in a six-month period I had a whole video where I kind of highlight and break down that and that's where this question came up is on that video where I highlight and break down uh the things that I did all of the parameters that were put in place to make that possible in that time frame. came uh with of course a doctor's supervision but like it it was rigorous to do it that quickly. Um and and then so during that though I mentioned about training but I didn't go into great depth right and I figured here I'll go into great depth on that training first and then explain what I do today. So that training back in 2023 was actually the Arnold blueprint workouts that were modified for the tone.
