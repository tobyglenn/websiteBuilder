Believe it or not, the Garmin body battery will actually take it into account. So, if I have a purely strength-based training session and then I look at this Garmin, so right now it shows my body battery. Oh, I'm at 5%. Okay, so apparently that strength training session today was brutal. Whoops. So, yeah. Uh, my body battery is at five. [laughter] So, that's about as low as it goes. I didn't realize it, you know. I'm assuming it can go the whole way to zero.
