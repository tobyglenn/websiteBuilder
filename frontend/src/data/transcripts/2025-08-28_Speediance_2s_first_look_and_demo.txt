Welcome to Toby on Fitness Tech. This is my first look at the Speedians 2S. Please hit a like, hit the like and subscribe button if if you like this kind of content. Uh especially the like button if you know if you want to see more information on the Speedance 2S. Uh I just received this yesterday, so this is truly a first look at it. I got it home, put it in my living room right now. That's why it's sitting next to the original Speedians. It's actually meant to go up in my office, and I can explain that in a little bit, but I wanted to give you the meat of the the uh review right away. So, there were two criteria on is the Speedian 2S worth it for me? Full disclosure, when it was delivered, by the way, it's delivered by pallet to my house, uh, unlike the original Speedians, which was actually just straight up delivered into my house because they had to they brought it up on a dolly and it was a lot smaller of a package because it didn't have a bench in it. And I think anytime you're buying one with a bench, I'm pretty sure it'll come um in a pallet. So, it would it was delivered via pallet. And I'm not sure if that's all of them or specific to the 2S, but the 2S was delivered on a pallet. Uh, which is kind of a big deal because that was delivered right into my house. This one was delivered to the other end of my property and I had to figure out a way to get it from there into my house. And it turns out that meant unboxing it outside and bringing it the whole way back across my property into the house. Not too big of a deal, but definitely a shocker when when it and it came relatively early in the morning. So, was not expecting this. So, over lunch, it ended up getting put into my house. Um, definitely an interesting experience getting this thing in. It required unboxing it outside and just rolling it across because these things are in rollers and then lifting it into the house. Uh, definitely a more uh interesting you know, experience than the original Speedians. That was just a month and a half ago. So, these units are actually both fairly new. These are not old units. These are new units from Speeds uh within two months of each other. So, the meat and the potatoes of this though is is the 2S worth it? And my answer to you is it depends. You know, I'm not going to give a yes or no answer. And and for me it it was two criteria of is it worth it? And that was how loud is the device and does it feel heavier and and significantly heavier. And the reason why I bring that up is I just did a video on the tonal and the tonal 2 um and my decisions around moving away from tonal. That link is in the description below. Uh you click that to go back and see why I left the tonal. And my justification for buying two speeds is at the end of the day to replace the tonal is the tone two total cost of ownership is actually more expensive than buying both of these devices. Which is absolutely crazy to think about the math on that. that you can buy two devices, have one in your office, one in your living room, and still be money ahead of buying a tonal and advertising it over five years. Um, the for the life expectancy of the device, which I think is about where I got with the tonal is about 5 years before I bought these guys in total. Um, maybe four years, something like that. Four or five years. But yes, so my two criteria is is it quiet and is it heavy? So first, is it quiet? So this is in standby mode and it's dead silent. So there is no noise coming out of this Speedian 2S at all in standby mode. I was shocked. I thought it was not actually on because that's not the experience of the original Speedian Gym Monster. Uh, so I was, you know, very shocked that this power supply makes no noise in standby mode. And that's incredible to me. And then when you actually turn it on, you will hear a slight noise. And I'll pause for a second and I'll pipe in the audio of the noise that it makes when it's on. So that's the noise that it makes. And in my opinion, that noise is perfect for in my office because I already have an air purifier up there. And this noise is quieter than the air purifier's noise. It's about equivalent to somewhere between low and medium on the fans that I have above me. Uh when the fan was on medium, I actually couldn't hear this. So I have a fan that's right next to me. And that fan on medium, I can't hear the speeds at all. So, I actually thought it made no noise, which is perfect. So, that means this is quiet enough to be in my office and to be able to do sets, you know, like on the hour, once an hour, if that's the cadence that I want to do, and just leave it up on the screen and do them as I get time kind of thing. This makes this absolutely viable for my office and as a true replacement to the original tonal if I think it's heavy, right? And so I wanted to demonstrate that for you real quick because the real the real and I actually tried it ahead of time just to see what it would look like when I tried. Um so I could deadlift a lot of weight. Um, so I was expecting this to be trivial, but what I forgot about, and you can see it's already set to 260 pounds. So, this device is actually already set at that weight. I want to make sure that you can actually see the Yeah, you can actually see the 260 on the screen. So, it's it's it's already set to the max weight because I was already trying this, but I I forgot that these devices, the 200 lb, the 260 lb, they don't feel the same as when you're freelifting. And what that means is, uh, my one rep max on bench on a free lift is 245. I had never hit 200 on the tonal and I cannot max the original speediness on bench in general. So like these devices feel far heavier because you don't have the momentum to carry you through. So just realize that I'm expecting this 260 lbs. Well, at first I thought, oh, it's going to feel a lot lighter. And that's because I'll explain to you what Tonal did with the Tonal 2. And so I was expecting this 260 to actually not feel much heavier than that 220. Um, not 40 lbs heavier. And well, I'll turn it on and show you. There we go. [Music] Okay. By the way, I'm still getting used to the ring clip and where I should be placing this ring. So, this ring clip was actually a huge addition that I didn't realize. The original speed doesn't come with it, but this ring clip is actually makes it feel a lot more like the tonal and I think it probably should go like that to be able to click it a little easier. So, I'm hitting it with the back of my thumb. But I can tell you when I'm doing that on the original speed dance, well, you can hear I'm out of breath, right? Um, I would have to be at if that was six reps and some of those reps were questionable at best. It's in terms of the quality of the form, that kind of stuff. It is way heavier. I can do basically unlimited reps until my cardio fails on on the original speeds. And that felt heavy. I mean, that felt way heavier than it did on the I was shocked. I was absolutely shocked at how heavy that 260 lbs goes. I'm actually going to have to work to be able to deadlift on this thing, you know, and you can hear out of breath muscular fatigue. I can feel it. That's the other thing. I don't even feel it in my quads when I'm doing deadlifts on the original Speedies. All I feel is my cardio get tired. Like at at two the 220 versus 260, it's a massive difference. It it it absolutely and it gives me room to grow uh with with my benching ability, uh getting back into squats if I ever get back into them. So, this device will give me a lot more room to grow and I'll be able to grow into it. And even something like deadlifts, it provides real value. So, which honestly the all of the other machines, the tonal, the speed dance, there was no value to deadlifting on that for me because it wasn't hitting any of the target muscles. It was just a cardio workout. Like, I can do cardio outside and go for a run. Like, I'm not going to waste my time doing cardio on one of these machines. By the way, that is also my opinion of doing cardio in one of these machines, unless unless you're specifically buying like the rower or like you want to learn how to ski in like bal like there's like specific things that this thing does. Like I actually just bought the the skirs uh because I wanted a second clip and they offer a bundle deal of this clip plus the skiers for a discount on them. And I'm like, well, I don't I didn't feel like paying $40 for this little metal clip. But for whatever reason, if you combine it with the ski urgs and make it a h 100red bucks, it it's easier for me to justify in my head like ah this cool thing that maybe my wife will use these ski urgs plus this little clip that uh that I think is awesome. Like that really is a game changer. Uh it doesn't come with the original speeds. So that was the second part of this video that I wanted to explain to you what what I think you should be buying. And honestly, my personal opinion is you should either be buying this device or this device. And now I'll explain to you the big con of the original Speedians. And it's not going to be what you expect. Make sure you want to exit. Okay. So, the big con of the original Speeds, in my opinion, is of course you're not going to get as much resistance, but you're not going to get as much resistance if you buy the the Speedians 2, right? Um, but the big con for me in particular is the noise of the device. And your mileage may vary with the noise. So, I actually reached out to the Speedians team and was 50/50 on returning this whenever I originally got it because this was supposed to replace the tonal up in my office originally whenever I purchased it. But with that noise, I couldn't I couldn't justify replacing the tonal up there. So, I ended up, you know, keeping it downstairs and trying to make the decision on it. But I reached out to the Expedience team and they said yes, that is normal that the power supply can be that noisy. There's nothing wrong with this device. It's just the variance. Some people got loud ones, some people got quiet ones. Uh and if I turn it on, you'll be able to hear it. That's the other thing. In standby mode, it's pretty loud, you know. So, it's loud in standby mode. It's loud during startup. It's the power supply fan. It sounds like a a late 90s era PC actually is what this sounds like. I actually had a gaming PC back in the day that is the same loudness as this device which is pretty funny to you know 20 years later hear the the power supply fan noise of that of that you know machine. So, this um this device and I could show you me deadlifting on that and show that it's, you know, infinitely easier. I mean, it's it's just infinitely easier. I'm not going to bother to do that today. If someone wants to see them side by side, I can do that. But yeah, this is significantly easier. I'm going to pause for a second and let you hear the fan noise to understand how much louder it is. Okay. So, that should give you a good idea of the difference in the noise and [Music] and so even whenever I put this thing in standby mode, you heard the fan the fan tilted a little bit in its noise and then stayed at the same volume level. So again, this isn't something that's a big deal for in my living room. Um because in my living room, it's always loud. There's a TV blaring. You know, I've got kids running around. So this for my living room, this was perfect. But for my office, it was unacceptable. And there was a thought in me of returning it. But once I got the thing, I loved having eentric mode back. I love being able to do workouts right before I go into the gym in the morning and have it down here because I'm usually getting ready down here and drinking my coffee and all that kind of stuff I'm doing down here. So, I loved having a device that was down here that I wasn't tracking on a spreadsheet and bringing out my iPad and checking off pieces of detail because what I was doing uh when I turned off the membership on the tonal is I was tracking everything by spreadsheet but I that also meant that I could track for the first time ever my adjustable dumbbell workouts. So, back behind these devices I actually have what the original speed is replacing. So, the original speeds, I apologize, I didn't unload the weights from these. These are the new bells. These are the 80 lb new bells. These are one of the best adjustable dumbbells on the market, but they're very, you drop them and you're going to break them. So, I also have and I don't have the weight loaded up on this thankfully because these go up to 90 pounds. I have the Power Block Elite 90 EXP, which if I want to do carries across the floor and back, you know, these are still going to live on for carries across the floor because it's pretty cool to carry 90 lbs across your floor because that, you know, that's a thing every every guy wants to be able to do. And it's pretty cool to have those at the max weight. And so I have all these back here. And that's that's what this is that's what this original Speedians is replacing. So, I already had an adjustable bench down here to use these. So, I already had everything I kind of needed. Now, I will say some musthaves for the original Speedies. If you do go the route of my opinion is you should either be buying this device because you want to futureproof yourself, you want the maximum weight possible. Everything on this, by the way, seems redesigned from the original Speedance. I don't know how much of it was redesigned in the two versus the 2s. I can tell you the speaker definitely came in the two because that's one of the things they advertise and I'm assuming some of the other redesigns like some of the cabling redesigns came in the two. I just don't know how many of them. It's very clear that this is a different cable cord. This is a different cable attachment style. Um this back this back latch system is totally different. And I don't know if it came with the two or the 2s, but there's actually a very big difference. And this will be huge for someone who's firsttime user and doesn't read the manual and doesn't watch my review. So, not probably any anyone who's listening, but someone who doesn't read the review, doesn't uh doesn't read the manual and decides to use this thing. So, if I put this up So, I put that up. I'm going to move these off of here real quick. So, slide these up off. Take this thing out of standby mode to make this easy. Uh, all of these devices in the tunnels like this, too. You need to take them out of standby mode when you're moving things around. It makes the cables a lot lighter lighter and looser. So that's one of the things that you forget about and all the machines are like that that I like. So this is now up here. So the big thing is the buttons on the side look the same, but watch when I hit this button. So if I'm down here and I hit this button, right? You see that? It's going down nice and slow. It has like a spring in it. So that I don't know if that came with the two or if that's new to the 2s, but I tell you that's a giant addition because well, it's only a giant addition if you're an idiot like me and the first time you have the device, you sit here like this, hit the button, and drop it on your head. I'm not going to do that because this thing weighs about 30 lbs and it it didn't tickle whenever it hit me in the head. Thankfully, I do jiu-jitsu and it's not the first time I've dropped been dropped on my head, hit my head. It's a pretty common occurrence, but it was it was not my favorite experience. And I realized when you're taking this thing down with the original speed and and it's telling you this, but I didn't understand this graphic, right? Um, the way to do this is hand here, hand here, push, and if you're strong enough to hold it with one hand, you know, I think their thing has you holding it with two hands, but if if you can lift over 30 lbs, which hopefully within a couple weeks of using this device, you could do that, or a couple months, depending on your starting strength level. Uh, Yiki one-handed it, but you have to have that hand up there when you hit that button because I dropped it straight on my head. So, that that was uh it's just one of those kind of odd nicities of this new device. And I can tell you it met my criteria for buying this and putting it in my office. And in my opinion, you should only be looking between these two devices. uh you either have the money for the latest greatest higher weight best of breed Speedians and there's no question this is it. Um or you're looking to get a great device um and you don't care about the loudness of the device and in in that case this thing's phenomenal. I mean it can do everything this can do. um except it doesn't quite have the weight. And that's where I don't understand where people are saying, should I buy the two or the 2s. It's like that's not even the question I'd be asking. It's should I buy the original Speedance at, you know, right now it's on sale for like $2,400 and it ranges between 2,400 and 2,600. It's never it's never the full price anymore. Um or you're paying almost double for this device. And I actually do think the double the money is worth it. Surprisingly, I really thought when this thing was sitting on the other side of my property, I'm like, I'm going to get this thing into the house. It's going to be loud. It's not going to feel heavy. It's just going to get returned. You know what I mean? That that was my initial thought. I'm like, this thing is getting returned. You know, I paid full price for both these devices. There's no I didn't get any discounts. There's no I'm not sponsored by Spedience in any way. Uh these are completely unbiased reviews and and so I really felt that this thing was just going to get returned until I got it in here and realized all of the small changes on the device. Uh even like, you know, the bright that's down here. I'm like, they made so many adjustments to this device. It's got to be quieter. And sure enough, I mean, it's near silent. Oh, and the other thing that I wanted to discuss, why these speedes when I was replacing the tone, not another device. I saw a lot of that on the Reddit community of people who are not who who decide not to get the speed dance and get another device. So, I don't want any advice that you can't do a lap pull down on. So, if I'm picking the ability to deadlift and squat or the ability to do lat pull downs and accessory work that requires the handles to be up high, um, so cable pull downs, all that kind of stuff, I'm picking that every day because you got to remember that my strength training is also a recovery modality from other things I'm doing. And when I was squat, deadlifting, and benching, I was constantly injuring myself. So, more on that in the tonal video that's linked below. I don't want to go into the full details of why I switched to one of these types of machines, but the specifics on this machine instead of one that's on the ground is I need the ability to have this high cable attachment. So, a lot of people are picking other small like cheaper digital trainers that can do almost the same weight that are only on the ground. Well, those aren't even an option for me. like those are immediately eliminated. And then I also then get want to get into a device where the membership is baked into it after my experience with the tonal and them raising the membership price on every single member and basically saying one month you're paying this, one month you're going to pay that and if you don't like it, oh you can cancel and we'll break your device, you know, good luck, right? I really didn't like the idea that I would lose basic functionality if the company decided they don't have enough money. So, I really wanted to focus on a device that doesn't have a membership as its core functionality. And I know a lot of people are upset over the AI coach stuff that is now $10 a month on these, but none of that matters to the way I build programs, the way I lift. Um, and and I'll be moving this up to the office and totally replacing the tunnel, replacing all my custom workouts from like I have a whole bunch of custom workouts that are now on spreadsheets that were from the tunnel. That's all going to get put on this machine and I'm really excited about it. I'm really excited to be making this move and but but yeah, this machine I think lives up to the hype. Like I think it's worth the money. if you either need the extra resistance or you need a quiet environment, which is a very weird requirement. Um, the only case I would ever see buying the Speedance 2 instead of the Speedance, the original Speediance. The only case I would ever see buying that thing is if you specifically need the sound system and then realize you can buy a Bluetooth sound system for a couple hundred bucks and save yourself a ton of money. Like you don't have to pay double the price on a on a resistance machine to have a good sound system. Like that seems ludicrous to me. But that is the big addition of the speed. And they added one arm position, which is honestly not going to matter. Like that just frankly doesn't doesn't matter, right? They just shifted where these where these are. Like that's pretty much irrelevant. Um because you can see there's L9 on this one and there's L8 on that one. They just added a level, right? They re they redid the leveling system. The top one's a little higher. The bottom one is actually about the same position. That's going to be irrelevant. I'm sure some of the internals were upgraded with the Speedians 2, but not enough that they could actually push the additional 40 lbs of weight. And I can tell you that 40 lbs feels heavy. You know, it feels like So, these things are at 45 and this is lighter, far lighter than that additional 40 lbs. So, it feels like they added, you know, 60 to 80 lbs of traditional weight. So, I'll put this thing at 60. So, I'm going to put this thing at 60. This is why the new bells were awesome. Yeah, it feels like an additional 60 lb of weight. So, this feels like the additional weight from just trying to deadlift on both of these devices. It feels much closer to 60 lb than it does 40 lb. And I'm not shocked at that because the original speed came out at to mimic tonals 200 lb. And I can tell you the tonal at 200 and the speediance at 220. They feel the same heaviness. So just realize like those numbers are kind of funny numbers, right? And in fact, Tonal, uh, this is one of the things I didn't get into the in the Tonal video, but I might as well get into it here because I have a little bit of time to explain it. Tonal actually re-engineered their 0 to 50 weight on the Tonal 2. Um, so realize it goes up to 250 lbs. This goes up to 260 lb. I would theorize this 260 lbs feels way heavier than Tonal's 250 lbs. And here's why. Because when Tonal redid the weights, I highly doubt Speeds recalculated all their weights when they went to 260, right? And they don't market any of that. They don't tell us any of that. But Tonal did and they made the mistake of doing that. And then I questioned them on it and they said no, but they didn't give me any details. So my question to them was they re-engineered 0 to 50 to be lower increments between the weights. Meaning like if it was one pound between weights before, it's 7 now between the weights. And the the reason why they did that is to make the weights feel closer to the natural weight because I will say it it's not a criticism of the tonal or the speedience. The speedian seems a little closer actually, which might make sense because their original range was 0 to 220 and that's actually their 0 to 220 is actually tonals 0 to 200. Like I would imagine they're actually similarish weights. And so their weight is actually closer to what it would feel at 40 lbs of a dumbbell, right? So, you're you're bicep curling and that 40 lbs is is similarish to the 40 lb on a dumbbell, but the tonal 40 lb felt like 60 lbs. Like, it felt super heavy. So, they re-engineered that. And you're thinking, "Oh, well, great." But this device also adds 50 extra pounds. So, they just took away, you know, probably about 10 lbs of weight. 15 pound, I'd say, 15 pounds of weight. The new device is not 250 lb. It's 235 lb. Right? So, it's so afraid. You spend five grand, you bolt something to your wall, and then you realize it's not any heavier than the original. At least this one, there's a 30-day money back guarantee. I can ship it back to them, right? And it's not bolted to my wall. Like, I don't have to make the decision up front. Uh, this thing's going on my wall in 30 days. I want to return it. I got giant holes in my wall. They don't fix those, by the way, if if you if you send it back. They also have a return policy, but realize you got giant holes on your wall. So, uh, and I was very afraid that they're they're 250 lbs. Because they said, "Oh, no, we didn't do that." But what that would mean is from the only way that could mathematically work is if from 200 to 250 they added weight. And that's exactly what I think Expedience did here. That 220 to 260 feels heavy. Like feels really heavy. So, I'm guessing they spread the the spread from two 220 to 260. And this machine is is is far heavier than I expected. So, I I'm very impressed with the machine so far. So, for a first look, I can tell you if you want the best experience on Speedance in terms of weight capabilities, uh, this is the guy to go with. And if you want lower cost of entry and not just like a little bit lower cost of entry, um, but a lot lower cost of entry, I mean, this, if I was, if this thing was as quiet as this, it would have went up in my office and I wouldn't have even been entertaining a new device that's 260 lbs. I would have been waiting for a device that could do like 400 lb, right? But because I couldn't actually replace the tonal with it because it's just too loud, I kind of had to wait around and uh and I didn't want to buy the two because it didn't have any additional weight capabilities on it and I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade to justify. But with this device, it is. It definitely is. One other thing though, if you're buying the original Speedians and you go that route, I would recommend buying your own adjustable bench. That's what I'm looking at in the background. I'm looking at my own adjustable bench. So, I would buy your own adjustable bench by the base model. And then the other thing that I would buy, let me see where I have them. Yeah, so I have them in here. So, I would buy two things, and one I didn't find out until I got the Speeds 2S. Um, but these are the power grips. These are their Bluetooth handles. Uh, these are 200 bucks. So, I would buy the base Speeds, the $200 handle. And I know it sounds dumb to spend $40 on this thing, but I would definitely buy this ring clip. So, I would be buying the ring clip. I'd be buying the Bluetooth handles, and that would come out to an additional $240 on top of it. You don't have to buy them day and date. Uh, but I would pick one to buy day and date. So, I'd either be buying the handles, which is what I bought, or I'd be buying, if you're going to be doing more bench style stuff, I would be buying this clip because if you lift heavy, I mean, I'm just going to be blunt. If you lift heavy, you can't put that ring on your finger. Like, there's no way, you know, I mean, but realize this is someone who's lifts heavy enough to break the inards of a tonal handle. And it'll be very interesting if I do it with one of these within a couple years, you know, within five years because I I'm I plan on getting stronger again uh over the winter. Right now I'm getting leaner, but over the winter I plan on getting stronger. And I'm really curious if I can do the same thing with one of these because it's actually pretty cool to think that I'm strong enough to to to snap the inards on one of these. Um and and it still worked, which was mindboggling, and I imagine this one will too, just because it built pretty tough. Um, but yeah, I would I would definitely splurge on getting these Bluetooth handles, getting that ring clip. Uh, if you're benching, the ring clip is a mustave so that you're bringing up and down and then you're pressing with the you're pressing with your thumb outside. So, you're taking your thumb and you're rotating it out and clicking. um instead of this concept of having the thing on your finger and trying to hit it with your other finger because it's actually making a connection with the bar. I can't imagine people can lift heavy with that thing on their finger and not, you know, not be pretty have a sore finger because I'm gripping, you know, when I'm lifting something, I'm gripping as hard as I can uh when I'm lifting heavy. And if you're not gripping as hard as you can, that means you're not lifting heavy enough. You need to up the weight. I mean, that's kind of my bottom line on that idea. The a lot of the accessory movements, obviously, I'm not gripping nearly as hard, and I was able to use the ring. So, I do a lot of like flies and and this this style of motions, these lateral raises, that kind of stuff for all of that. And that is actually why I kept the machine is because just to be able to track the lateral raises, the cable flies, all the other stuff that I do that adds volume to my workout and to not have to enter it into something like the time consuming nature of entering in, you know, for months I've been, you know, I would take these things, I would I would take these new bells, I bring them down, I would start at 15 pounds, right? I'll do it with just one hand. I'd start at 15 pounds and I'd be doing these lateral raises, right? So, I'm going out doing these lateral raises and then I'm counting all of my reps. I'm tracking my sets. I'm putting them into the log book. Then I'm upping the weight to the 20 lbs to the 20, you know what I mean? And I'm trying to progressively overload these like I do everything else. But it's adding so much time and I feel like it's so it's so big of a waste of my time. And I'm very conscious of this is an absolute waste of my time uh whenever it comes to not actually progressing things and to be checking this off in my log book is just flat out annoying. So to have a machine that can do all that is going to be great. The one thing that I have noticed so far is if you do have two machines, it does log you out of the one machine when you log into the other one. So that's going to be something I have to be cognizant of. I can use the Expedience app, scan the QR code and it logs me back in or type in my password. Uh, so it's not a deal breaker, but it's definitely something that it doesn't just you click on your name on either one and it connects you in. I wish it did that. I wish it didn't actually boot you out of the other one. Uh, also it doesn't have this machine doesn't have like so over here it doesn't have like it doesn't have the history of that machine. So in the notifications, so the notifications area in particular is going to be machine specific, but in your like in your profile and in your app, you'll have all of your workouts. So don't worry, it's tracking it all and it's tracking it all across devices. I was a little paranoid about that at first. It does track across the two devices perfectly fine. Uh, I I personally feel that the 2S and I cannot believe I'm saying this because I really thought when it was sitting on the other side of my property and I realized I had to bring it like 5,000 ft across my property on in the box across the whole property. You know, the the second I actually went to pull it out of the box, I realized, oh no, this is a very different device. Even though they look, I'm sure at this distance they look the same. I'll show pictures below of the differences and you know they are very very different in small ways and those small ways add up to making I think a big difference in the long run and I think you'll be very happy with either device if your circumstances are right. So, if your circumstances are this thing's going in a living room or in a gym where you're clanging and banging around and you don't care about loudness and you don't care about having the latest, greatest, heaviest device ever, you're getting this one. Like, this thing's phenomenal. Like, there's no question if I had to pick this or the tonal um ignoring the loudness factor, right? I would pick this in a heartbeat over the tonal, which is pretty wild. I will say there's one thing that is different about these devices, and that's the tonal's arms when it's at the top is over here, and these arms are up here. So, when you're doing lat pull downs, you're going to be wanting to do them on your knees to get the maximum extension, especially if you're 6' tall like me. But I did most of my lat pull downs on the tonal on my knees anyways. So it was like, you know, my lat pull downs were always done on my knees anyways. I wasn't doing them standing and I very rarely did them from the the bench anyways cuz the bench wouldn't give you it would be more of a horizontal pull and less of a vertical pull. Uh the difference in where the arms end up because the arms on the tonal end up higher and out. But very few things on the tonal use the maximum arm height. And in fact, the arms feel kind of sketchy on the tonal at the max because I've done it the maximum weight on the tonal at the highest point. And it it actually didn't break the device, which is pretty mind-boggling. And uh Coupe from Garage Gym Reviews actually shows him doing this and I've done it on the tunnel, which is just mindboggling. uh which you're not going to be able to do on this device because of the way it's engineered or unless you're like 100 pound 5'4 girl, you know, uh you're not going to have this device pull you up, but I was actually whenever I was down at 185. That machine can can launch you into the air. It can actually pull you up to the machine and it did it with coupe, too, which is pretty cool to see something bolted to your wall that can pull you up. So, I'm not saying the Tonal device is not a phenomenal device. I'm just saying when you include cost as a factor, either of these two devices are a far better investment of your money in my opinion. And my opinion is if you want the latest, greatest, best device on the market, I actually think the Gym Monza 2S is that. So, that's a pretty wild standpoint for me to have considering there's so many of these devices out there. I'm actually going to get a chance, a buddy of mine has the Oxfitit. I had never gotten a chance to try it. I'm actually going to get get a chance to go out there and try it. I vetoed that one because the Oxit has a membership like Tonal. You don't know if their funding is going to still exist in a couple years. It also requires professional installation. It it has all of the trappings of tonal without obviously being bolted to you all directly. Uh it's still not a very movable machine. It's but I I want to I want to get the chance to try it. I mean I'm I'm a nerd for this kind of stuff. I'm a nerd for all of this fitness technology. But that was my first look at this 2S. If you have any more questions on the 2S, uh shoot them over to me because I know I already got questions from a couple of my buddies on the rower in particular. And I'm sad to say I don't have it. So, uh, it's not something I have. And the reason why I don't have it is sitting right next to me is the Teeter Power 10, which the Teeter Power 10 is not much more expensive than the rower for the Speedians. And if you're apples to apples buying something, I think the Power 10's a better device for your money if you have the space for it, right? This comes down to space. The one thing with Expedience is they market themselves on being a low amount of space required. And what's funny is I actually don't care for my office. This ability to pull this up and down and have a spring. Ironically, I don't need the one with the spring in the office. And I'd rather have the one with the spring that lowers it down slow down slowly downstairs. Like I wish that feature was swapped on the two because the one downstairs is going to get pulled up and pulled down. the one that's upstairs in my office is always going to stay in down position. You know, it's just always gonna be down there because it it doesn't matter to me. It can just stay in the down position. You also notice the whole time I was talking in in this review, this was on and uh that could never happen with the original speeds. It is that loud that I had to immediately turn it back off afterwards because it would distract me because it's that it's that loud of a device. And that's not everyone's speedians. Uh so the the power supply loudness is very variable on on your individual speeds. And honestly, it's not a deal breaker for anything that would be in a gym. I mean, I had a PC that was louder back in the day, and I obviously dealt with that for years, but I had giant headphones on when I was playing video games. And, you know, I I had a giant PC, giant headphones, 32-inch monitors as a huge gamer back in the day. And that's where this passion for fitness tech came from is it came from a passion for technology. I mean, I'm wearing two different devices right now, and I'll probably discuss those in the future, too. uh the the Whoop versus the Garmin versus the Amaze Fit because I got the Amaze Fit for my wife and going to do a breakdown of those three devices. But this was the first look at the Speedian 2S. Uh the rower I don't have. I I have the Teeter Power 10. I would love to try out the rower. I'm not opposed to people sending me stuff, that's for sure. I will try it out and let everyone know that it was sent to me and I didn't pay for it. Uh, I'm not opposed to trying that out and showing what the rower is capable of and comparing it to the Teeter Power 10. Uh, but for my money, I can't justify. And I thought about it actually because it this, you know, and I actually asked the question like, why does this not come with the rower? It it did not make sense to me that for the most expensive, highest end device, they're not shipping it with the rower. the only thing that I can think of and this is what really had me hesitant to buy it and I I went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Should I get this thing? Um because I think they're going to come out with a Speedance 2 Max which has a bigger screen like they did with the original Speedance and has the rower and has all the the other stuff bundled with it and come out come out probably but it'll probably be at a if they do that it's going to be like at a $5,500 price point even if they don't up the resistance which they might do something where they have the ability to up the resistance by changing the way the motors work. Um there'd be the very there there'd be the potential of somehow putting motors in the base and then and then have a separate cable system for the base. Uh if if it had a separate cable system for the base and had uh had the ability to like connect the motors in some way. So it had cords running from the bass into there. Uh some sort of a system that kind of powered the bass itself. And the bass had its own power had its own cords. they could get that 400 500 pounds of resistance that the Vituvian has. But that's a complete redesign of the way these things are built. And people were asking, you know, why is this thing so much more expensive? And it's like these small redesigns cost a lot of money and a lot of R&D. So, I'm not willing to pay for something if it provides value. And even like their clip, I I was a little iffy about buying their clip because it's $40, but these are all metal clips. Like these are not Foxcon produced pieces of plastic. You know, these are actually a pretty expensive clip the way they've designed them. And and obviously the power handles are an absolute must in my opinion. I just think the world of those kind of devices. Now, I will say there's one thing that you saw whenever I went to deadlift with because this ring. So, if I click this thing. So, right now it clicked in and now you hear that noise. So, this is a very big difference from the speedience to the tonal. And so I'm adding one more thing to the review that I think is very important for you to realize that when you turn on the tonal, all of its stuff connects immediately. And so it's it's all connected ahead of time. So if you go to turn on the handles, turn on anything with it not connected into the device in any way, it's already connected. So it's turning it on, right? this you wake up the individual device by itself to keep the battery life because all of these are all of these are uh charging. So they all have like batteries in them and they have you know their own like lithium ion batteries whereas the tonal stuff is all uh actual batteries that you put into it. So they're all I think double AAA battery I think they're AAA batteries. Can't remember. or I've only had to replace them I've had to replace them twice on the tunnel and every time I go to do it I always forget. I think they're double A's. Maybe some of them are AAA some of them are double A. I don't remember. But there's a whole bunch of batteries. There's actually batteries in the arms too in the tonal which you really forget about and I only had to replace those once and you forget about them and then everything stops working. Uh this has no batteries anywhere. These are all charged devices, but because they're charged devices and not battery operated, they actually need to turn on like you have to turn them on separately of turning on the machine. They don't automatically wake up. Um because they're Bluetooth and they're and and they're um and they have their their own small batteries inside them that are rechargeable. And rechargeable batteries just don't have the kind of lifespan of a of a regular battery. You never want to put rechargeable batteries in your tonal. I thought about doing that and that is a very big mistake. Uh you want to use, you know, fresh, you know, Duracell or I mean the Amazon Basics batteries work too, but like you want to use good quality batteries. Uh these things because of the way they work, you have to wake them up first. And you could see I didn't do that and you had to wait for me to to turn on these devices. These are little things that my wife didn't understand when we switched to the device. And so I have to kind of teach her like, hey, you turn on the device first. So you turn on this and then we turn on the handles and then you go, right? We turn everything on and then you start your workout. Otherwise, you will get frustrated. Uh that that's a big one with this in particular that's just different. And the other big criticism from my wife so far, I will tell you my criticism of the wife because she's been using this because like I said, she boycotted my tonal after in that tonal video I go over, she boycotted the tonal after my cable fray. And so she's been using this to work out and her big criticism of this is their workouts adjust these levers far too often and adjust the implements far too often. And that I noticed, too. And I'm just going to have to give her a set of custom workouts that I think are maximally beneficial for her and go from there so that she's not doing the speed dance workouts to be honest with you. So there's a bunch of speeds workouts and they should be pretty cool. You know, there are a lot on here of different things that you can do. You can see it's recommending something. Um but you can see in here like this this is handle this is barbell you know this is barbell different position this is barbell different every single thing on here is a different position like literally they don't move through two things at the same position and for someone like me and my wife who wants who want to who want to do all of their stuff back to back to back um so we want to we want to superset everything that we do this makes it impossible to superset. Like this is you can't superset this workout at all because you have to move the thing. Uh that's a huge flaw in the way I think their workouts are designed. But for someone like me who always did their own custom workouts, not a big deal. For someone like my wife who always does the workout they recommend right here, I'm going to have to create for her custom workouts and figure out what I think is optimal for her situation because this is this is ludicrous. I mean, you're literally changing implements and changing handle positions every single time, which is just timeconuming. And it's not that time consuming, but it's if you're someone like me who wants to get in, get out. Hey, exercise, exercise, exercise, exercise. Um, warm up, warm up, warm up, workout, workout, workout. Then this methodology is honestly garbage. Like, it's just it's just not the way I would do things. and and it was one of the things that I asked in the Phoenix community and they didn't have great answers of like what workouts for her to do. It was more go the custom route and and even in custom you can't pick by uh arm position which is something that I hope they add. It's something that tonal added at some point in time, the ability to filter by arm position that uh because now I have to kind of guess what the arm position should be and you can see it in the picture, right? You can roughly see in the picture where the arm position is, but the ability to filter on arm position would be a massive benefit. There's small things that would be massive benefits that the tonal has added throughout the years that I have a feeling this company will add. Uh, so Apple Health integration isn't there unless you have an Apple Watch. There's like small things that I wanted and I reached out to them. And the one thing is when you reach out to them, they say, "Hey, we're we haven't started working on this. We plan it for like Apple Health integration outside of the Apple Watch." They're like, "Hey, we plan it for Q3." And I'm a developer, so what that means is it's probably not coming by the end of the year, but it's on the radar. And for me, that's awesome. You know what I mean? for them to be transparent with, hey, hey, hey, this is on our radar. We already have it on our road map. It's just not it's not a high priority item, so it's slated for Q3. Um, you know, that that to me is awesome because when you reached out to Tonal with feedback like you want an adjustable bench or back squats, especially back squats, it's dead silence from the company and the user community has to theorize they think back squats are too dangerous for us. The company won't tell you that. Uh adjustable bench. There's there's never been an answer. Like this device has been out for five years plus. Doesn't have an adjustable bench. Doesn't support an adjustable bench. Doesn't support adjustable bench movements. And the company won't even tell us why. Whereas Speedance, it's like, "Yep, we've got this slated not the top of our road map. It's already in our to-do list." And I think that's just awesome. like and and this is a company that like is not an English first company. I could tell whenever I was talking to them and their feedback was phenomenal to me and even even on the power supply issue. I reached out to them on that to see, hey, is this dangerous? And they're like, no, no, no, no, no. We have a lot of them like that. It it's very variable, you know, how loud these things are going to be. That's normal. that's within the tolerable range for expedienc's acceptance criteria for shipping these things out. Uh cuz I reached out and said, "Hey, this is my exact loudness on it." And to me, that's a totally acceptable answer. And you know, I have PCs, like I said, that were louder than this device. So, I really feel like my experience with Speedants, the company, so far, has been great. I know the Speeded official channel, you see all of these horror stories of like things that went wrong, but the one thing that I also see in that Speediest channel is a they allow freedom of speech. Like people can post that. You can't post that in the tonal official channel and people don't realize that that is heavily monitored. Anything potentially negative can't go in there. Anything support related can't go in there. Uh and they won't get back to you. By the way, if it's support related, they won't get back to you. Just to let you know, you have to call them to get them to and then your mileage may vary on whether they actually just tell us pass more money or, you know, actually handle your support issue. So, uh, with Speedance, they allow freedom of speech in there. So, you're seeing all of these reports of things that go wrong and you're also seeing people from within the company trying to fix it for these people, right? Which I think and sometimes it takes a while. Like you got to realize with these machines, you know, you might have an issue that causes you to not be able to work out for a week or two, right? You, in my opinion, need to have a backup system, right? For me, I mean, my backup system is is right down here. You know, I have adjustable dumbbells. I have a full squat rack. I have a full weight set downstairs. I have a full backup system of what happens if one or both of these machines stop working. Uh some people don't have that luxury, but just realize with any of these digital cable machines, you have to be prepared for them to stop working. Uh even the tonal like and the tonal company is not going to be any faster than these guys. In fact, they might if you're out of warranty, good luck even having tonal do anything without saying pay us first. You know, they're not going to from my experience with that company, they're not going to they're not going to support you in any way. Speedian is if you're out of warranty, they'll say, "Hey, here's the replacement parts. Here's how to do it." They'll send you links on step-by-step guides. I mean, from what I've seen, they're absolutely great to their customers. They're not going to say, "Pay us money and we'll even discuss this." Right? So, I've been uh very happy so far. It's been like a month and a half with this device, and now I got this one yesterday. It's going to go up in my office today. And I'm super excited to start the journey with Speedy. It's started all over again. 9 million pounds lifted on tonal. I want to see if I can hit 30,000 30 million pounds on these devices in the next 10 years. So yeah, I want to see if I can hit 30 million pounds lifted on these guys. So we'll have it, you know, 9 million on the original cable machine and I want to have even even more weight. So 10 years, 30 million pounds is the goal. So, and over over a 10 years span, what you don't realize is in one day you can't get much done. You might you might be able to get 10, you might be able to get 20,000 pounds. You might be able to get 50,000 lbs on a day where you just tort yourself, right? And with this machine, I can do deadlifts, which means I can I can hit that poundage goal a lot faster because this thing actually hovers my quads, actually works my body on on these heavy lifts. So, I'm actually going to be able to hit the weight a lot faster because I can do some of the workouts that I just said I'm not going to do on the tonal because it felt really uncomfortable. max weight, 20 rep sets of 200 lb of deadlifting. And it's like, what's the point? I'm just doing a cardio workout at this point in time. And and I don't do cardio on these machines. So, at this thing, I can feel it. You know, that's six. I did three reps yesterday, I did six reps today, and I felt every bit of it. So, I'm very hopeful. Uh, this was my review or my kind of first look review of the of the 2S comparing it to the original Speedance. Thank you for your time. Again, like and subscribe. I I can put out a bunch more videos on different pieces of equipment that I've bought throughout the years. I'm a big technology fan. Obviously, these aren't my only pieces of equipment. Uh, but these are definitely, you know, my new favorites, that's for sure. Thank you,
