like I I I think I can win that match. You know, I've I've faced people that size before. Um you know, I've gone the whole way up under my neck in matches against them and everyone worries that I'm going to be paralyzed someday from doing that because uh and my coach yells at me constantly because I will I will flip my whole body up to try to shoot triangles and stuff like that and launch attacks off the ground while people are standing. And I'll do that by putting my whole basically all my weight onto my neck. Uh, and so if someone Mike Isertel's size decides they're gonna drop down and forward, right, uh, you know, they they literally could break my neck and it's just a risk that I'm willing to take to try to hit those submissions.
