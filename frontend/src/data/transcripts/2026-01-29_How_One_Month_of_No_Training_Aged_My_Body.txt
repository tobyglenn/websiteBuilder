So it has an algorithm for the reason why I kept it for 18 months is it has this feature uh called like the health I don't know what they call it now but it's basically gives you an age gives you a score which is an age and some people were complaining oh it shouldn't be an age and it's like well that's just an easy representation of how well are you doing and by the way right now I'm older which I had gotten it to where I was younger last year and uh younger than my actual age, but now I'm older than my actual age because of all these vacations. It turns out if you do no training for an entire month, uh you will definitely age
