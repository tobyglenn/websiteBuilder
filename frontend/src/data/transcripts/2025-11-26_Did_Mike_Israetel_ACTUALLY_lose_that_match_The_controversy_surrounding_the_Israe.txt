And Greg Ducet did an even more insulting video when it's very clear that the Mike Ezrael Johnny Shrieve match Mike Ezel's gooping around and the other person didn't use much from that video because it really doesn't paint Mike Isertel in a negative light if you watch the full because that that I had actually seen back whenever they shot it and I you know my takeaway from the that match whenever I is watching it is Mike Israel's goofing around, right? So that it's entertaining, right?
