Um, I do believe in progressive overload as the primary factor in growth. I'm I'm more of a Mike Menser fan of, you know, lower volume uh, harder sets. Like not all of Mike Menser stuff, but like in general, like I also agree with Mike that that uh Mike Menser had a sweet mustache. Uh, and I had to shave mine off today. I was so disappointed. I actually had a pretty pretty nice mustache and my wife made me shave it so she will not allow the mustache.
