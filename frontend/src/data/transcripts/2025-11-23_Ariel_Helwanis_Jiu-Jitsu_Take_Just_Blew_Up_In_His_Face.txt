And Ariel's was more like Greg Ducet, I would expect that. I mean, he's a bodybuilder. He's an IFBB pro. Like that's not his, you know, and he does like these hit pieces on people.

But for Ariel Hwani to not understand that Moneyberg would stand no chance against Gordon Ryan and not make it past 30 seconds, uh, shows, especially for someone who's commentated, who has a black belt behind him. Obviously, it's not a real black fellow, but for him to do commentary on MMA and jiu-jitsu all these years and have such a lack of understanding of jiu-jitsu is kind of insulting to
