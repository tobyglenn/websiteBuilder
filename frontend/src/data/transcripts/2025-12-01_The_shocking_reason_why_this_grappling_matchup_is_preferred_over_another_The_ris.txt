because at least I know I'm not going to hurt Gordon Ryan, you know, like there's a pretty like I know how that match ends and it ends with me losing, but there also isn't this risk of me like spinning wrong or falling wrong or doing something dumb. You know what I mean? Cuz like I'm not going to I'm not snapping Nicki Ryan's limb in an arm bar or or a leg lock of some sort. like I'm not I'm not going to end up, you know, heel hooking or leg hooking him and and injuring him that way. It's going to be like me falling and and landing on his knee or something like that and breaking it into pieces. Um whereas with Gordon Ryan, he's just, you know, he's obviously more sturdy, less injuryprone and bigger, right? Much much bigger. Uh now Nicki Rodriguez, I would not I would not want that matchup like that. That's a I mean that's a strong powerful human being who's also known for being really hard on people in the gym. So that that would be a concerning match. I guess what I'm getting at is I don't think it's fair for all this criticism of Mike Isert's Black Bow. I think the Derek Moneyberg stuff is is way more uh more critical. I do think some of that needs to needs to go away. Like if I had went out there in that jiu-jitsu tournament and lost all my matches, there's no way I would even accept my black belt, you know, the next time, you know, the next time like I would have to go back and fix that, right? But we got to see that I can win on points. Uh we got to see that I can also win with my reverse triangle. Uh you got to see a little bit of the dynamices dynamicises especially because I was losing like I was losing the whole match.
