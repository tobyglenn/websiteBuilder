Like if I had went out there in that jiu-jitsu tournament and lost all my matches, there's no way I would even accept my black belt, you know, the next time, you know, the next time like I would have to go back and fix that, right? But we got to see that I can win on points. Uh we got to see that I can also win with my reverse triangle. Uh you got to see a little bit of the dynamicises dynamicis especially because I was losing like I was losing the whole match uh because I was gassed uh when I hit that reverse triangle and I knew there was less than a minute left and they went for an plata and I flipped them into my reverse triangle and it's actually a thing that I do like in the gym. It's not like it's something I've trained, right? And something I've worked on to be able to hit my reverse triangle from, you know, from the receiving end of a nomatada, right? So, I'm locked in it. And then I spin and and and flip into this thing. So, it's uh you know, it is a thing that I've worked on. Uh, and I was able to hit it in a competition, which is pretty cool because I've never hit it against someone that high level, right? I've hit it and I've hit quite a few times and I usually end up hitting it on our purple belts or our upper blue belts because to hit me in a nomatada, you have to have a level of skill. So for me to hit that reversal, you know, requires like that combination.
