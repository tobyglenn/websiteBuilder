standings. Oh my gosh, so many curl options. That is one thing with this machine. There is not very many missing exercises. So, my critique of Tonal was always it didn't have the exercises you want. The critique of this one is it's hard to find some of the exercises because because it has everything you could ever want, which is a much better it's easier to do in the app. So, I should have probably preloaded this, but here we go. Standing single arm bicep curls. Ah, here's the dual handle. The dual handle is what I actually want for this. So, I'm going to add it, right? I'm going to close out all these extra sets. I'm going to set my rest to 45 seconds or 30. I can set it to 30 if I switch it to stamina. So, switch it to stamina. Close out of all these other sets because I only need one set of warm-up. I set this to 30. I set my weight to 20. And I set my reps to the lowest amount volume possible, which is 13. So I'm setting reps to 13, weight to 20. Right? Then I'm going to move my bench out of the way so you guys can see this. Going to add another movement, but instead of adding another movement this way, I will show you another button down at the bottom. Uh there's a sequence option. So I'm going to click this sequence option. And I'll tell you why I'm going to click this. Because whenever I click the sequence option, I can click add and it will add the exact exercise and it'll put it in the next sequence and then I close. So this is a way faster way of getting one more set, but it'll be and this is why I'm using stamina for everything now because literally I could just add my next set of my actual working set and then change these values to be the exact opposite 15 and leave it at 13 actually. So, it's going to be 203 1513. And now I'm going to save. And then here it'll show me my weights. So, I'm going to put the screenshot at the bottom of the screen for you. Now, uh, I'm going to start out at 22.
