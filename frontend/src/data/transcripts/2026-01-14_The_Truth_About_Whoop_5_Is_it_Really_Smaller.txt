So, all of the Whoop reviewers who say that the Whoop who spout the company narrative that the Whoop 5 is smaller, let me make it crystal clear. This device is not smaller than the Whoop. Let me see if you can actually Let me bring it up up up. So, this device is not smaller than the Whoop 4. Let me make it clear. It is not smaller than the last generation device. And you're thinking, what do you mean? They say it's smaller. Yes, they do say it's smaller. And you know what they do to say it's smaller? They have made it. So, if you look at this device, I wish I had the the four to show you, but there are some people who put them next to each other. And the one thing that they any reviewer who does it right will will tell you immediately is if they put the device next to each other this way, this device is thicker, right? So it has massively improved battery life from the boot 4. And but what they did is they made it narrower and a little bit like thinner this way, right? both metrics that don't matter. Like the the length actually matters for people with small wrists, but I don't have like I don't have big wrists, but I don't have small wrists. So, like you could have gone out an extra inch on this like, you know, across my wrist and it would have still been fine. And I think the Whoop was like slightly bigger. Like you're talking about like just enough that the bands don't work. That's the other thing. They made it so that none of the previous bands work from the last generation and it feels intentional. There was no need. They could have made it the exact same form factor with a new thickness, which would have been thicker, but then they couldn't say it's smaller. So, I think their trade-off was actually not as malicious as it feels as a Whoop
