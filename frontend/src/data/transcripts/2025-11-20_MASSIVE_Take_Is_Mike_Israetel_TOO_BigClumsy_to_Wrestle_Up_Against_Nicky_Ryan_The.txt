injuring Nikki Ryan, especially not at that gym with all of those monsters. Like, I would not wrestle up in a way that could be potentially and we know that Mike Isertel has to be slightly clumsy. I mean, let's face it. I at that size at at that height, there's no way that he has the kind of stability and control in a wrestle up to not accidentally fall. And if he falls on Nicki Ryan, he probably breaks something on him. So to criticize him not wrestling up, one, sometimes I get too tired to wrestle up. So, like you can throw that same criticism at me that you throw at Mick that uh Mike Israel that he's not in the kind of shape he should be in, right, for for jiu-jitsu, right? That's a fair critique.
