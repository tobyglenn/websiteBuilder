And I realized when you're taking this thing down with the original speed and it's telling you this, but I didn't understand this graphic, right? Um, the way to do this is hand here, hand here, push, and if you're strong enough to hold it with one hand. You know, I think their thing has you holding it with two hands, but if if you can lift over 30 pounds, which hopefully within a couple weeks of using this device, you could do that or a couple months, depending on your starting strength level, uh you could one-handed it, but you have to have that hand up there when you hit that button.
