Having these digital cable devices save me so much time in setup. I can just go to the machine, hit my custom workout, hit go, not think about it, put the handles on, put the bar on, whatever implement I'm using that day. I leave them at one implement per workout. There's never a workout where I switch implements. Um, so that it's even easier. And I also escalate it so that the so that the uh so that I don't have to move the positions very often on these. So, it's up here, middle, and then down. Uh there three kind of sections. And uh and then the calories, I I could never do it without a GOP1. I don't get full and I'm constantly hungry. So, P1 versus Fentramine. Uh in my opinion, I mean, I love the fentramine. If if if I ever got cleared by doctors that, hey, you can take fentamine. Uh, I would actually prefer to take the fentamine over the GOP one. I mean, that's just the honest truth. It was um it was just as hunger and appetite suppressing to me as the GOP one is, and it was a heck of a lot cheaper. It's like a quarter the cost. Uh, the steps were outrageous. I mean, I don't get nearly that kind of steps today. I like to shoot for 10,000 uh steps a day. I really like to shoot for that. And I was falling short of it for quite a while. And I'm getting back to getting close to this number. I don't ever get this number.
