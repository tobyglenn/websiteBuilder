Um, but the big con for me in particular is the noise of the device and your mileage may vary with the noise. So, I actually reached out to the Speedians team and was 50/50 when returning this whenever I originally got it because this was supposed to replace the tonal up in my office originally whenever I purchased it. But with that noise, I couldn't I couldn't justify replacing the tonal up there. So, I ended up, you know, keeping it downstairs and trying to make the decision on it. But I reached out to the Spedian team and they said, "Yes, that is normal that the power supply can be that noisy." There's nothing wrong with this device. It's just the variance. Some people got loud ones.
