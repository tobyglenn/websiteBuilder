They took those blueprint workouts, they put them onto the tonal, but the problem with the way they put them onto the tonal is they were split over multiple workouts. They included the off tonal components. So, there's a whole bunch of exercises that Arnold did that you can't do on the tonal. like the tonals uh amount of exercises is like minuscule in comparison to what you can do on the speed dance in terms of number of uh number of different exercises. The speed dance has it trumped by a massive percent. Uh, and that's just something important to realize.
