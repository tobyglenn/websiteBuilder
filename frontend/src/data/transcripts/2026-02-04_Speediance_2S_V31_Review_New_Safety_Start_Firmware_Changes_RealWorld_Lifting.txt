Hello and welcome to Toby and Fitness Tech. I figured today I would go through the V3.1 software, talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly with this new software update. Uh I've been working out on it for a couple days. Uh I also got a new firmware. So uh I reached out to one of the Speedians teams on the community, one of the team members who is also in the community. uh she got in touch with them, got me the new firmware. Mine has a different firmware version than the people who had the Speedance uh twos. So, this is the 2S, by the way, for anyone who's new to the channel. So, I have a Speedance 2S up here, and I have the original Speedians downstairs in my living room. So, you'll see some of my videos where I'm doing them, uh especially with my daughter, they're all downstairs on the original Speeds, and you'll see me do some videos up here. Uh typically with the 2S, especially because this has the latest software version. That one does not. Uh not through anything I did. It just did not update like this one did. There was one person on the internet who claimed they had an original Speedius with the 3.0 software at the time because 3.1 wasn't out yet. And I reached out to them and said, "Hey, um you know, can you show me what happened specifically on?" So, if I go into one of these screens, if I go into freelift, there's this new safety start button that that button in the last video did nothing uh because I didn't have the new firmware. And I had actually intimated in the last video if that firmware breaks the retraction in any way, I would prefer to not have it and not have this button work. So unfortunately I got the new firmware and yes the retraction is not as good as it once was and in fact not as good as it is on the uh machine downstairs. It's noticeable. Um it is not it is not actually with the way I lift a lot of people are complaining that when they lift the retraction is really bad whenever they come back. So, what I'm talking about here, if I can show you real quick, is let's just say I move this up here and I pull and then I go back real quick. Look at what it did. Do you see that? That is wildly unsafe. I pull and then I go like this. Look at what it does. That is wildly unsafe. That will get caught. You know what I mean? And these things will end up bricking like it's and and I I was actually told it's not a bug. It's a feature. Let me tell you, if you lift in that fashion, you're going to end up getting cords tangled and you're going to have a nightmare of Luckily, these are all user replaceable, so it's not the end of the world, especially if you're under warranty. Like, if this thing gets tangled, uh you you can figure out a how to untangle it. It'll probably like with the user manual, you can go through and untangle it. It it's just not something I would want to have to do. You know what I mean? uh especially because of a bug that they've implemented to implement a feature that I think is garbage. So let's start on the new feature. So this safety start now that I have it working I can show it to you and why you should almost never use this. I'm saying almost never use it because it has a purpose and it was done for a reason and I think that reason is a problem and I'll tell you why in a second but let me show it to you real quick. So, what happens is I have this safety start and I realize that you can't see my screen right now, but I'm going to guide you through basically what's going on. Um, so hold on. I have to unset it. So, I click the safety start button that's at the bottom of my screen. And first of all, it's called safety. It's it's not a safety feature. It's a fix a different bug that's on the speeds. So, in my opinion, so if you click the safety start, I pull it to where I want it to be. I wait. I hit confirm. And now this this chord is now locked at this position. So I want to make sure you can see. Yeah. So right now this is the uh minimum retraction of the cord, right? It will not retract the rest of the way the full time I'm doing my lifts. You see that? It ends right there. And in order to do that, they slowed down the retraction altogether in all circumstances. I think this will be fixed in a future firmware update because it's going to annoy enough people uh if it annoys me. The kicker is it annoys me and the way I lift. I never run into this scenario where it retracts slowly inside the lift. But I'll show you where it does retract too slowly for me and it does bother me. I would rather work out on the downstairs machine right now. In fact, if I had my choice of the two machines and this is the 2S, the latest and greatest. And I'm not on beta software, although and and I'm also not on firmware that is well, the firmware may be slightly beta-ish, but I know there's other users that got the last point release of the software that have the same problem and demoed it online. So, I know I'm not the only one, but the reason why this feature exists, let me show you what's actually going on here. So, let me cancel the safety start and bring this into an actual position that I would end up using. So, what ends up happening? Let's bring them out here. Hit safety start. Uh, pull out the cable. Oh, well, didn't didn't realize. Okay, it's pretty simple to do. Right now, I hit confirm. And what this is going to do is make it so that if I go lifting, sorry, let me bring this over here. If I go lifting, right? Did it really only do one handle? It only did one handle. Give me a second. Go here. Look here. Do you want to cancel the current safety start? Yes. Safety start. Pull out the cables to adjust them. Okay. Confirm. Huh. Now it only did the other one. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry. I know what's going on here. That's a hilarious bug. Okay. Sorry. I was testing out the dual load mode and that's hilarious. Safety start in dual mode is the most broken it's ever been. That was something that I was going to discuss with you guys later, but I'll discuss it now while we're going through the negatives, right? um they brought back um the partner lift inside of Freelift which was not there and all the sudden the online uh community is happy but and then they said it was upgraded. Let's be clear, this is not upgraded because I was just using it downstairs two weeks ago. This is a massive downgrade from what they had before, and I'll explain why. So, the way it worked before is you had the ability to turn on and off each side of the weights. Notice there's only one button now. That means both of these have to be on at the same time. So, what Lily and I did last time, you can't even do anymore. You can't even do where I had her side on, my side off, my side on with 44 pounds, her side off, which was a huge safety feature to be honest with you. If you want to talk about safety features, that was a safety feature. This garbage is not a safety feature, right? I I'm just going to be blunt about it. That safety start is not a safety feature. It's implemented for the Pilates that's coming in the future. I understand why they did it. I understand why they made the sacrifices they've made to the overall I think quality of the retraction and other things to make this happen. Like I get it. It's a means to an end. But I'm telling you as a feature on its own, it's not a good feature and especially to take away a true safety feature of being able to turn on and off the individual sides within Freelift mode. The other thing that Freelift no longer has is they it no longer has the guest profile at all. I was wondering how they would bring back such a complicated feature that was a already broken because uh these are the smart handles that are $200 and it couldn't turn on and off the individual sides even though they're marked left and right and they are implemented left and right. Meaning when you look at the charts and graphs um the left one moves the left, the right one moves the right. Like they are implemented left and right. And I think they're slightly like adjusted so that they're not quite anyways but they are they're marked right and so anyways it the smart handles couldn't turn these on on and off. So it was already like not foolproof and also it was using a guest profile. had no ability to log in additional users who are actually on your machine. So you can't count this lift against their profile. So realize it was already slightly broken. This is not something that like already worked correctly. But now you have a situation where you can't even turn on and off the two individual sides. You can't log in a guest user in any way. And actually there was a complaint online where whenever you were in so this is dual handle dual load mode where each side can be lifted independently. Right? But um and you and that what that means is I have two different weight settings. Right? In the old version I had two different weight settings. I had two different profiles. I had the ability to turn them on and off independently. And they brought this back in two weeks though. So realize whenever I saw it not in the software, I'm like this would take I'm a software developer and this would take me three months to bring this back. Like the way they built this V3 software, it would and by the way, if I brought it back, I would do it the right way, which is not what they did. So So that's the other thing. If they told me to do this uh to do what they just did, realize I'd quit. Like I I would actually quit, right? I would say you guys can build I would do one of two things. I'd say you guys can build that in the interimm and I'll work on the real solution while you're building that because it'll make my solution easier to implement. So you're going to save me time, but I'm going to work on the real solution. I'm not working on this, right? Like that that's the type of person I am as a software developer. And there's there's a re there's a reason why I can afford two speedes, right? Let's just put it that way, right? Um so yeah and and that stick tuitiveness of like this is the direction that we need to go is uh is something that has kind of gone throughout my career and if I was going to bring back freelift mode one I couldn't have done it in two weeks so I couldn't have even did what they did because I would have wanted for both dual load mode and for For barbell mode, I would want I would want um the ability to I would want the ability to for both of these dual load barbell modes. I would want the ability to actually go in and have my logged in secondary user use their profile and count the reps against their profile. So, a dumbbell, you'd have to select your user somewhere in the screen. Realize I'm I'm showing a makebelieve screen and not what's actually on the screen because none of this is implemented. But when you're in dumbbell mode, you would you would select your user. You would select either the first one or select the second one, right? And when you're in dual load mode, it would give you both people uh on the screen and they would each get a side marked based upon the color of the person up top. like one would be one color, one would be a second color. Barbell, the same where you would select one of the two profiles up top. So you'd have two profiles up top like you had in the old free lift when you were in dual load mode and then you would actually have the ability to log in that second user. And I would carry that across the system. So you would have this is why it take me three months. You would have freelift mode where you can select either guest or either of your two profiles when you go into a program, right? You would be able to generating the report. Yes, I don't care about your report. When you go into a program, you would then also have the ability to select your second user. Right? So the way you do this in a program, go into the program, instead of selecting solo, you select partner. That's at the bottom. And then you hit start. And then it asks you for a second user. But here's the problem. There's no guest on this, right? So I have to have a logged in user up here. I don't because my wife's profile is downstairs. realize this works downstairs and we we've worked out together, but then we have to use their programs. I would bring it here to these programs. I would bring it I would bring it to custom, which is what everyone's been this is the feature that's been most asked for for the community for 2 years. Tonal's had it since day one. It's inexcusable that it's not here at this point in time. with the V3 software. I'm making it very clear they needed to bring this like they needed to bring the ability to have a second user in your custom workouts. Uh especially if they're going to implement in my opinion like what these features come from is things that tonal have already done. So with the tonal 2, they launched arrow row and their Pilates is kind of like arrow row you know I'm they're analogous right and so they had to make all these changes to bring Pilates to this machine and realize they're bringing Pilates to this machine I mean yeah there will be more equipment and attachments but essentially for free whereas Tonal launched it with a new device and you had to have the new device and there there's a reason also like Pilates is only coming to the 2 and the 2s s and that is because there is actually a processor upgrade. I know it doesn't say there's a processor upgrade on the website and I didn't believe there was a processor upgrade because why would you not put that on your website and then I got the individual specs from the the the dev team themselves and yes there is a processor upgrade and what's funny is when they announced Pilates and safety and safety start are not coming to the old device every and that there were specific hardware requirements were that weren't in the old device. Everyone's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't show on your website that there's hardware differences." And I had the same reaction except I'd actually talked to them, realized, "Yeah, there's huge hardware differences that they didn't tell you that would have been important for your buying purchase, except these are additional features, guys. These are and also safety start is garbage, you know, like so, you know, and and the device downstairs works great. Like the original speeds works great. Obviously, you're not going to be able to do Pilates on the thing, which my wife might actually have wanted to do Pilates. So, that's kind of a disappointment that the machine that she has access to all the time, that she can work out on all the time, doesn't have that feature. But, in the grand scheme of things, a free update that might not come to an old device, I'm not worried about it. People are really up upset and rightfully so, about not getting safety start. And what I mean by that is they called it safety start and they say it's a safety feature and then it's not coming to the old device. And I think it would be capable of bringing that feature to the device. But I know why they're not because they've actually only built it to do Pilates. So it's not a feature like this ability to lock at a specific length was necessary to make Pilates work on the machine. So that's why it's not there. But let me explain to you why I think this is garbage. And it actually came from someone's post that I realized anytime someone online makes a post and then you don't see a picture of them or you only see their face um or or like it's a picture of an animal or landscape or something like that on Facebook, you realize they probably need to lose some weight. Not to be mean, but like that is typically the case. And of course, this was one of those people and they were talking about how they use Safety Start basically on every single motion on the device and want the ability. So, whenever you're uh between exercises, it pops up a screen where you can skip the rest or whatever else like you can skip the rest, you can add more rest, right? And then it shows you the important thing is it's the only place on the machine where it shows you the the arm positioning. I mean outside of hitting like three button presses. There is a there is a way to get to it and I have to do it frequently because I don't look at the screen. I like do my lift, go somewhere else, do some work, do do my lift. Like even while you know I get interrupted during my lunch break. So, someone was thought I'd be really mad cuz they interrupted me during my lunch break. And it's like and I was just lifting anyways. Like you can interrupt me during my like what's up? Like it's if it's important enough to bug me, it's it's important enough that I can do my lift after we get done with our conversation. And sure enough, it was important enough to to to bug me. People usually know which conversations are important enough. But anyways, yeah, we we have so we have the safety start and someone was using this for every single thing. And you can imagine how one how much time this adds to your exercises to go through here. Let me make sure that I'm actually not in dual handle mode. Yeah. So I'm in barbell mode. So now you'll see it. So if I pull these out, right, internal and safety start. Pull them a little bit more. Confirm this. Now they're locked in this position. So why did this thing why? First of all, what what's the point on this? Is it really not locking that one? Why did it not lock that? Okay, that's just a bug. Is that a bug the whole way through the system? So honestly, I haven't used this very much. And whenever I went to test this, I was testing it on a unilateral exercise. Give me one second to test this in a custom workout real quick. So, custom workout. Um, actually, let's give it a barbell workout. Sorry. I want to test this real quick live. So, let me give give you a second. Let me go switch out my barbell. So, let me give you guys the barbell here. So, barbell in the ring clip. I'm turning on the ring. That's what I just did. Brig's pretty quick to turn on. Let me turn on safety start. Hold still. Yes. So now it works perfectly. Give me one more second. I want to try one other thing with this. So see how now both of them are not retracting. Um that was that was the goal. So now I only have this range of motion right here. And the reason why people were doing this, I can actually show it to you here. So they're going out here. They're turning this on, right? Then they're going to and I'm not going to do the actual motion cuz this might actually throw me into the machine. But right now it won't be able to throw me into my the machine. Scared me a little bit because it moved this this one right away. But it you notice how it didn't throw me into the machine. Right. This this amount of weight. Let me see if it would throw Yeah. Yeah. That amount of weight would probably There we go. I can actually push it. But yes, that amount of meat, wait, you can see it push me back. That would be enough to throw me into the machine normally. So that's the benefit of this. I'm not saying it's not without benefit, but let me explain to you how I actually work out and why for the way I lift this doesn't matter. Right? So if I go turn off the weight, uh turn the safety start off. Do you want to cancel the safety start? Yes. Right. Then we go back. Put that there. Put that there. Right. So, I want to check one more thing with you guys. I want to check this on a handle motion. So, let me exit this exercise. End workout. This is going to have some really weird workouts. So, because I'm only doing a couple exercises, let's go with chest handles. Hit start. I want to test it with with with handles, not in freelift mode, because this might just be broken in free lift mode. So, this one's left. This one's right. Okay. So, let me test this real quick. Let's do that same thing. I want to see if it's broken. If safety start is broken in freelift or just broken for handle movements altogether. Right. Okay. So, we go out here. We confirm it. Huh. That just broken all together. So, we go here. Yes. Let me try to do it. Let's do it this way. Safety start. Pull them out the handle. Maybe it has to be pulled out after you hit the button. Ah, that's the key. Okay. So, I was doing it wrong. What you saw me doing is I was pulling them out and then pulling them out a little further and then and then um and then I was turning the safety start on. I have to pull them out the whole way. But here's what made that really interesting and why this is odd. This one wouldn't retract. So, the the left one to me, the right one to you guys, that one didn't retract. The other one did. So, it's very weird that they don't behave the same. And I also noticed that this one is slower in general to retract now, like of the two. And that could just be a firmware thing. In fact, I'm I'm pretty sure it is a firmware thing and it'll get fixed. That's not something I'm too worried about and it doesn't affect my workouts. But here's what people are doing, right? They're coming here. They're turning these on now, right? Is it on? Come on. Turn on. Can do it. There it is. Okay. I can't tell if it's on because it's not pulling me back. It's such a weird motion. So, they're coming out here and they're doing their sets. Right. I don't know if you realize this, but the fact I can't even get a full stretch now. I needed to be here. Right. So, what this person's doing is they're doing this with every single set, including well, they probably don't do warm-up sets cuz I'm sure they don't watch my videos and they don't realize that you can use stamina mode with 1320 to build warm-up sets. They're probably not even doing that. They're probably all of their sets are effectively my warm-up sets would be my guess. Um, with the way they're lifting because if and if you're doing this, you're not getting the range of motion, guys. Like, this is hugely limiting. Let me show you what my range of motion normally looks like. So, let me turn this safety start off. Let me show you the way I would do this exact same lift. And it matters like especially for warm-up sets. Like I would never ever turn this. This is my warm-up set, by the way. So, I'm at four reps right now. And I am at 20 RM and I'm doing 13 reps. So, this is stamina mode. 20 RM, 13 reps. Oh, and by the way, I know I had I started off the video very negative on like what's broken on this, but I will tell you there's one major thing that I've noticed that the new software now prompts you and seems to always prompt you on bilateral mo movements. So, like this movement where you're using both handles or the bar on all of these movements, it now prompts you whenever it thinks it should give you a higher weight. It now prompts you and asks you to accept the higher weight or select between multiple higher weights that it gives you. I think it's finally fixed. The bug that caused a bunch of people to be using safety start to begin with is actually gone except in unilateral movements. I'll get to that a little later. But realize for bilateral movements, for bar movements, I think they actually fixed the issue that was long-standing of it throwing more weight at you than you can handle and not being able to handle that specifically with V3.1. So realize I've been lifting I've probably lifted 75,000 lbs on V3.1 and I've seen it several times and I'm thinking they actually fixed the issue for at least two of the three, you know, cases of the way the handles are configured and the handles in the bar. So let's go in here and let me show you. So this is the way I left. First of all, in an ideal world, I wouldn't pull these out ahead of time. Sometimes I do. I forget and I pull them a little bit out. But in an ideal world, I would actually have them back here to begin with. And then I pull them out and then I pull them the whole way. And every now and then it makes a ding, meaning that it just counted a half rep as a rep. I don't care. That doesn't matter to me. And then I go, I do my set. Especially with these warm-ups, right? You notice I'm getting way more range of motion than than I could have gotten with safety start on, right? And I feel it coming back. And I also have eentric up at max. So it's actually adding more weight. I'm going slow. Now watch what I do. I go back and then I go back to the machine. So what I'm telling you is I don't ever need the safety start, especially not for my warm-up sets. Now in my working sets, it might be beneficial if I'm lifting more weight that would throw me back to the machine. And even then, I don't like the idea of using that. I like the idea of using the one second pause. And by the way, I know someone once had an issue where the 1 second pause didn't turn the weight off, right? So that 1 second pause is enough that it's it's always turned the weight off for me. But if it doesn't turn the weight off or if I don't want to wait on the one second pause, especially whenever I'm coming across my body with a unilateral motion, sometimes it's pretty heavy and whenever I bring it back, I switch my grip and I come behind it and I bring it back two-handed and and sometimes I won't wait the 1 second pause and I'll actually bring it back to the machine. So, I'm actually always if I can bringing the the cable back to the machine still under tension is what I'm saying. And I think that that's more beneficial for your joints. Using safety start I actually think is going to limit your range of motion is going to I mean you see it here, right? She's down. I don't turn the weight off like when I would be done with this movement. So, she's doing I'll show you the movement that she's doing. Right? So, she's here and she's going down and up. Oh, see, you can see I don't have the weight on. Look at this. Look at that amount of slack. That's what the people are complaining about online. You can see the slack visibly. It's really uh concerning. And not only can you see it there, my only real like I don't have a problem there because normally the weight's on, but I have a problem with it if I'm up at L0 and I have to bring it down to L7. Watch this. This scares me. That scares me. It actually collapsed and you could see the cord like fold into itself. That's unacceptable. Like I'll be honest with you, they need to fix this. And I'm going to report it to them after doing this video just, hey, like th this needs to be on your radar to fix. And I'm sure they will fix it. It's not something that's going to stop me from lifting, right? I'm sure it would stop some people, but it's not going to stop me from lifting in anyway. But it is something that I noticed, and I'm noticing it way more on the video than I actually did in my real in my real applications. I noticed it in that scenario. That's the only time I notice it. I actually didn't notice it ever whenever I'm lifting. And that's because I get down into the position, right? I turn the weights on. See how it pulled my arms back? I want that. So, that's an a feature, not a curse. So, that I can get a full range of motion stretch. That's That's not a problem. Anyways, watch what happens whenever I end my set. So, I'm in here. By the way, I can only do this because these are my warm-up sets. I would I would be breathing so heavy and grunting and and and it would not look good in my actual working sets. I would not be able to do this and talk during it. So, let's just say I do two extra reps and then I'm going to finish it. I go up. The weight's still on. The weight was on the whole time, guys. I never had the weight back off. That's right. I brought the whole way up to the machine without the weight ever turning off. If you can't do that in your warm-up sets, you're not doing warm-up sets. You're doing working sets, right? And by the way, for working sets, sometimes I can't bring them the whole way off. I have to sit there and pause with them until it turns them off. And the real question is, what if it didn't turn off automatically? Like, what if I was one of those people? Uh, there was one person online where it didn't turn off automatically and they say it hurt them. Well, you know what I'm going to do? So, I'm not going to sit there and wait forever and let it hurt me, right? Realize it's never done this. What what that person posts about my machine, I have two machines lifted over a million pounds. It's never done what they were saying it did. So, I just want to make that clear. It has never happened, right? And honestly, if if it would happen, it would concern me and you guys would know about it. So, it's never not turned off the weight for me at the end of my set. I could see it happening with a software glitch. You know what I mean? It's not surprising that it happened to that person, but it's never happened to me. Anyways, what I would do, I just let go of them. You know, that person was like, they were in a position where they could have just dropped the bar. So, they were squatting and they could have just dropped it off their back, right? >> And they're like, "Well, I didn't want to hurt the machine." I'm like, "Okay, instead you break your spine." Like, what are you thinking? Like I don't care about this machine when it com compares to my spine or my shoulders. Like I'm just gonna let go of the handle and let it fly back and and hit hit the machine. These things are rubber padded. I mean these are way way better protected than the tonals were. So like you couldn't do this on tonal where you just let it go. that the the whole screen what I just did there where I let the thing go right the tonal would be flipping out at me because it does not want because the way these pieces connect at least the tonal one and it's probably the same for the tonal 2 they didn't do much I think they changed the material they they they actually changed it I think from a plastic to a metal right but it's still plastic on metal which means instead of instead of uh like you're going to damage this piece, right? This is metal, rubber, metal, right? Like it's it's the safest mechanism for being able to do that. I'm not saying the build quality on this machine is better than the tonals in every way, but I'm saying in this particular way, it it definitely like it's not throwing errors on my screen because it's not going to hurt the machine. And if that person had dropped their barbell, I mean, worst case scenario, it it it breaks. It wouldn't even break this thing. They would have been fine. They would have been fine. Like, they could have just dropped it. Like, I'm I'm pretty confident they could have just thrown that thing off their back, let it retracted, and and hit, you know, at the bottom of the thing, and they would have been fine. So, not to be mean to a user who posted a legitimate safety concern, but I it's one of those things where I always value my body over breaking the machine and I recommend anyone do that. So, yeah. In conclusion, I don't think Safety Start is something we should be using. I'm I'm so disappointed that they haven't brought us uh partner workouts in custom workouts and they didn't actually bring back partner mode and freelift the way it was before which was already broken. So, it's like you didn't actually bring back the thing. It's not new, revised, and enhanced. It's it's worse. It's definitively worse than the old freelift mode. You know, I only gripe about that because when the v3.1 Oh, they are doing a much better job of telling you what's in each software update. So they they used to be notorious for the bug fixes as the as the it's like what did you change right they're doing a way so they are listening to the community they they brought back freelift mode in some fashion or freelift partner workout mode in some fashion in two weeks which you you normally never see from a big business like that to be able to even bring it back in some fashion and uh so you know in some ways I'm critical because they're not giving me the feature I want and they're giving me features I definitively don't want. Uh, and I think most of the user community shouldn't want it. That person who was using Safety Star for every single one of their sets, they're either doing all top sets, right? Which, hey, more power to you if you can do, you know, first of all, I don't think you can. I don't think you know, you know, from a a logistic, you're going to hurt yourself. And especially, you're going to hurt yourself because you're limiting your range of motion on every single exercise you're doing. So, you're limiting your range of motion and you're doing top sets on every single exercise you're doing. That's a recipe. That is how I injured myself. Essentially, what they're describing, they're turning this into something that could make you way more injuryprone than what it is. Like the reason why I espouse these machines is specifically for that retraction, for bringing it back under high eentric load and keeping the joint safe because that means that what's going on with this machine is I'm able to make it so that I'm limiting my strength growth in the concentric um phase and accelerating the eccentric phase, which is the the phase where typically you would you They tear stuff. So people don't tear stuff in their concentric phase, they tear it in their eccentric phase typically, or at least me, right? Maybe I should just speak for myself. That's where all my injuries happen on free weights is whenever it's not when I'm pushing it up, but whenever it's coming back down, something tears, right? And that's because um it's because your pushing power was way more than my stabilizing power, right? And so it would or it would be when I'm about to hit the concentric phase. So by having the concentric eliminating and the eccentric loading at a higher weight, I'm always making sure that I stretch everything and actually kind of fix all of those issues. I find that way of lifting and to use safety start means I'm limiting that. And and to to be more specific, why people were very happy about Safety Start was a bug in the machine that I think they fixed for everything but unilateral movements. So I've already seen it with V3.1 where I actually have the setting. So there's a setting on this machine that is supposed to fix this and I actually already did a post about it. So like hopefully it's on the dev team's radar because I said specifically that my setting is set like that. So if you go into settings, right, there is a setting under I believe it's training preferences. So settings, training preferences, and then there is a a setting on here called 1 RM setting and it's both both sides jointly on the latest 1RM. Okay, that means that the left and right side won't get different weights except they have a massive bug. They've had it forever. it it goes away for like a release every now and then and then it comes back where it will decide you've PRD on one side and give you a totally different weight. And I've seen it and I wish I had screenshotted it um to send over to the dev team just so that they can like actually troubleshoot this in a real world scenario because what's happening is it thinks that you PR on side one and then it's applying a new weight to side two but unlike everywhere else where they prompt you, it looks like there's a bug still in this version of the software where it doesn't prompt you. It gives you the new PR weight and then it threw me into the machine. Well, it didn't quite throw me into the machine, but it gave me a weight that was the problem with it is because I'm using eccentric mode. If if I if I were to select its default setting, which is the most agre like aggressive at at giving you a new higher weight, um, you know, so the default setting is a very aggressive weight, which was like 10 pounds added. And 10 pounds plus like that's a lot of weight. you know, basically. And so it it was almost on on so I was doing, you know, like a high to low cable fly and it was it was so much weight that I couldn't even like I so I start them here and I went to pull it and I'm like I can't even pull this. And then it dawned on me to actually check and look and see what the last weight was. So, I'll show you that just so that I can give you an idea of how you can look at these things on the machine because you can actually track this. And I'm pretty sure I do have a Yeah, here's a whole one arm uh workout. So, we can show it here. So, what happens is when you do one side versus the other, there is this. So, at the top of the screen, there's a button that has like four uh four rectangles. So, it's music controls, four rectangles, power, right? The four rectangles button, uh, has screen rotation, move analysis, and move playlist. The thing you want is the move analysis for this. Okay, for this in particular, uh, and maybe I'm wrong, I am wrong. The thing you want for this is move playlist. So, um, move analysis is actually the one that you use. By the way, I usually mess this up at least once whenever I'm working out. So the move analysis is the thing that you use to figure out where it goes where where your um where your connection points go into the machine. So this move analysis tells you this is the piece that matters. And you notice that piece is past the scroll. So that's why this is really frustrating. And one user was like if you guys are going to do a new UI and do an extensive overhaul, put this information on this screen. What I'm saying is put the information of what level this thing is supposed to be at on the actual screen because this is one thing where I'm like, "Huh, why did I never have a problem with having to do three clicks on the tonal to figure out uh to figure out, you know, where these things should go?" And you'd think I'd know by now because I do the same workouts over and over again, but I forget like because there's so many different adjustment levels, which is a plus, right? Not complaining about having all of these different placements. I forget whether it's L4 or L5, right? And it bothers me that I won't have it at the right point. And sometimes, like here, you can't see like you can't see. Well, you can see because he's at the platform bottom, but when it's in the front view, if it was if it was on the uh on on the speedian itself, you wouldn't be able to see, right? And so some of the videos you have to kind of sit here and wait and wait and wait until you get a clear shot of the side to actually see which level they're at. And that's too much time. It's actually easier to hit the three buttons, the move analysis, and scroll. Like, believe it or not, that's actually faster sometimes than waiting on the video and hoping that you get a clear shot of the side rail, right? You can see this was a two camera shoot, by the way. So, they're upgrading all of his moves, right? That's what I was complaining about yet last time where uh his moves were all one camera originally, and now this one's two camera, right? All of the female uh Spanish speaking ladies moves are all three camera. So you get three different angles of the move. Like you would have gotten an overhead shot to be able to see better activation. This one's actually pretty good though. I mean you can see the activation of his muscles, which is pretty rare actually for a lot of his lifts. Um I wonder if he actually doesn't have it to the minimum setting on this. I wish I could see uh he has it on. Yeah, he does not. I don't think he has that on the minimum setting for once. So maybe he's also going through and fixing that whenever they do the updated videos because he was using the minimum setting and with it big and as strong as he is like he he gets no muscle activation so you can't see the target muscles which actually really really matters to me. I don't know why it matters to me because I'm this is how I work out by the way. It's muted right now. So that is actually how I do my real workouts with it muted. So, I didn't realize that the Spanish speakaking lady was speaking Spanish until until someone pointed out to me and then I I listened to it. I'm like, "Oh, yeah, she is speaking Spanish." But they're massively like they're always upgrading things. That's what blows my mind about the speed. It's like I can complain about the V3 software being, you know, trash. I mean, let's just call it what it is. Like I think all of these things are actually other than the the UX down here is much cleaner and prettier and more effective for what I do where I max the eccentric, it's so much faster to spin the eccentric to max whenever I create new workouts because realize when you create new workouts, every time you initially create a new custom workout, if you want max eccentric, you have to go and apply it to every single exercise individually after the creation of the workout and then it sticks and saves it. So, it's not a big deal because it saves it after the fact. If I had to do it every time, I would have returned the original speeds. Like, to be honest with you, if I had to reset that every time to be max eccentric, the original speed would have gotten returned. There would be no speediance up here. But it sticks the setting. And so, that's it's like someone asked for it to be on the other screen and it's like, dude, it sticks the setting. You didn't actually do your workout twice. Like, if you do your workout a second time, it remembers it. You know what I mean? like you didn't actually and some people jump the gun with these questions because the machine doesn't explain any of this, right? It's not their fault, right? When they're asking these questions that are like so basic to answer, right? Because the machine doesn't explain any of this and they're constantly iterating and changing. So that could change in the future. I could see it being on that on that menu and you know in a future update. It's just you know what the speediance team kind of prioritizes. my opinion, prioritize uh bringing uh partner mode into everything in your ecosystem. That's my opinion. That should be your number one priority. If I'm giving priorities, that's your number one priority. Pilates actually gets shelfd to make that happen. Like, you know, shelf everything that I realize they're not going to do that. They're launching Pilates soon, if not already. But that that would be my priority. Even believe it or not, bringing partner workouts to custom workouts, I would want above fixing this retraction issue. So, this retraction issue is an issue that could cause harm to the device. And I would still rather have partner mode inside custom workouts and across the board to where my wife can log in and we can do a workout together that I've created, right? that that's I mean that's paramount to me in my opinion, right? For now, she just works out by herself and you know that is what it is. But I would like to be able to work out with her, right? I I I just think it'd be much better. And when we did their workouts, I hated them so much that cuz it's not the way I train. I train with a whole bunch of warm-up sets, make sure my body can handle it, then I train with my working sets. And that's not how they train. They do a couple BS warm-ups and then they throw you into sets, you know, and and that's that's how the tonal was, too. So, I'm not criticizing like this is different than the tonal. Tonal's had more warm up sometimes, but it still was not an adequate warm-up for someone who is as injuryprone as I am. You know, I'm almost 40. I'm not getting any younger by day. Um, and I can lift some seriously heavy weight, but can I lift that weight every day? No. You know, it's varying on how much sleep did I get, how much time am I spending with the kids, how how, you know, what we've been doing lately. Like, uh, how much my nutrition's on point? So, everything matters to whether I can lift a heavy weight that day. And I want to know that ahead of time by the time I get there with a whole bunch of warm-up sets. And that's just my opinion on on that uh that piece of the the puzzle. But yeah, uh that's that's kind of my conclusion around the V3.1 software. Is it an upgrade to 3.0? Of course. Uh especially with especially with the idea that progressive overload, I think they fixed it for two of the three types of motions. So, fixing progressive overload to actually pop you up a message and ask you which overload you want and allow you to select none if you don't think you're ready and allow you to select between two different weights on each of your on each of your movements. It is a massive upgrade and I know it's not there for unilateral movements yet and there's just and that's just a straight up bug. Like there's no way that's not a bug. And it's been one of the more b prevalent bugs on unilateral movements. The way they work on the machine is just wrong. Like in in a fundamental level like they should not have they should not have rest between them. They should like there's a lot of things that should change about unilateral movements, but I would rather have the movements and have it in the current state and just be mindful that I have to click I have to click those four dots and I have to click move playlist and I have to go back because you can see I have 25 and 25. What will happen is I will do this first 25 uh well it doesn't happen with my warm-up sets usually. unfortunately happens with my working sets which are the set because I'm going at maximum intensity right so I'm going at maximum intensity and the problem with it is even if you do do extra reps sometimes if your velocity and your strength curve is high enough it'll be like ah you're good to go we can add more weight and for bilateral movements and for um for bilateral movements and for bar movements right so bilateral meaning two handles so for two handle movements and for bar improvements. It's now prompting me and has prompted me many times. So, it's not just once. Uh, which is an indicator that I'm probably holding back my progress a little bit more because I'm also selecting none on all of those for right now. uh just because I'm focused on running more than on lifting and I don't want to progress to a point where uh the running is impacted too negatively because it's definitely already being impacted by I lifted 35,000 lbs yesterday and that definitely impacted my run today. But uh the the the new the new challenge, you don't have a whole lot of time to do it and it's quite a bit of weight. So I'm going to hit gold on it. And I hit gold on the last one. I was to the last day to make gold. But these challenges, I love them. By the way, uh if there's one other thing that's motivational to me, it's some sort of a challenge where you can get the medal. The worst is I didn't even I didn't even put in I got the the the code to get the medal for the last one, but I was traveling and I was just busy and I didn't put the code in. So, I don't have the physical medal. But, uh they send you a medal. like they send you a real physical medal for completing these challenges and getting I don't know if everyone gets them. I think it's only a few users that get them. Um so I feel really bad about not, you know, not putting in the code and and getting the thing. But you know, life was just too busy. I was traveling all around and I didn't get a chance to do it. But uh it's still so cool like just that concept and it it it forces me to try to hit gold and especially because I don't want to be silver. Like if I don't make it at all, that's one thing. Like if I just miss the target alto together, you know, I'm okay with missing the target altogether, but I don't want to hit the outside of the target. I either want to hit the bullseye or miss the thing, you know? So that's kind of my mentality, I guess, with some of this stuff. That's my mentality in general, which is uh problematic in some ways. But back to this, I do think if and a lot of people ask me uh Speedians 2, Speedance 2S, original Speedance. I still love my Speedians downstairs. You know, I was lifting it on it last week. I was lifting on it a little bit this week. The device is phenomenal. I mean, guys, it's not it's a matter of how much can you afford, right? I have two of them, right? So obviously my budget is is what it is. You know, I I I prioritize my training. I prioritize my strength training. I realize strength training is one of the most important. Uh I actually got a comment on my last video whenever I was talking about running and how important it is because the Whoop uh triple counts running. And you know, and then I I did a little bit more research and they say it doesn't triple count running, but realize if I don't run, like today I got 9,773 steps on my Garmin, right? And so I'll get my 10,000 steps for the day, which is what the Whoop wants. But realize 7,000 of those steps was from my run. So, and that would put me in the red line as far as steps go, which would age me according to their algorithm very, very quickly, right? So, if I biked instead of ran, I would not get the steps necessary for the steps part of the algorithm just because I'm so I'm standing most of the day. I work at a standing desk. But, you know, unless I'm doing something really complicated, then I'm actually laid down working on it. But typically I'm standing and that standing doesn't count as steps and I don't have an exercise treadmill because it would be too for what I do with coding and stuff like that. It's it's I've never been able to code while I'm in motion. I guess if that makes any sense. I can take I can take calls. I can do business meetings. like you do all that stuff. Well, because I've tried the standing desk thing before and I was able to very successfully do a whole bunch of the management related job duties uh of my previous employment, but I've never been able to write code doing it. So, unfortunately, and maybe that's just a limitation I have and I I need to be able to figure it out. But, you know, I don't I don't work at a a treadmill desk, although I have one. There there is one like I have I have a treadmill that I can flip out and use, but I I haven't been able to successfully do what I do while on the treadmill. Anyways, that's all for me today. If you have any other questions about the speeds, about the V3.1 software, they need to fix this retraction issue. After this, I'll I'll actually put in a message because she Julia, I believe her name's Julia. She had asked me like I mentioned, hey, the retraction seems a little funky, right? And she said, well, it's not really a bug. It's necessary for the Pilates feature, but I'll I'll send her what it actually looks like uh just so that she can send it back to the dev team to see if it can get at least uh tuned uh specifically for whenever you're moving the rails like that needs fixed. And I apologize to them that the first time I actually ever had a concrete cuz I don't normally move them as fast as I did in this demo, I normally move them a little bit slower just cuz I'm tired and I'm sore and you know I'm not moving as quickly as I am now. I'm fresh. I haven't lifted today. So realize that that's a little bit of an exaggeration of how quickly I would move it. But you can see even even whenever I was moving it in general, I really did notice that the retraction was too slow. So, I'll reach out to the team. I imagine it'll get fixed pretty quickly. It's not going to stop me from lifting. It's not going to make me not recommend these devices, especially over the tonal that has that forced membership. And speaking of memberships, I am working on something myself. Not not membership related, but like there is there's an open source project that the creator of that project actually has the ability to build custom workouts and use AI prompts to build them. It's a very cool desktop application. Uh I'll put a link to it in the show notes below. that is something that you know give that give that person support and and I had reached out to them with a feature that I wanted to them to add but then I realized I could add that feature myself and so but the the thing is the way I built the new feature I can't actually bring it back into their application so I can't just do a pull request to them to to bring it back because what I did is I reimagined the whole thing through a through AI and So, it's it's giving me all of these dashboard. What I wanted in particular is right now you can use it to create workouts, but I wanted the ability to read all of my workouts I've already done and do calculations based on that. And so I took what they built and am working on something to actually extract all that information and give me my own readouts of what I need to do and and use a more I want to have a more comprehensive look at my total training picture with running jiu-jitsu and BJJ and the fact that I wear two two trackers and I also have the eight sleep bed. I don't talk about it very much but I do also have the eight sleep. I I never actually use any of its tracking, but now I have the ability to correlate all these systems together. And that's what I've been kind of working on on my offline. I I'll I'll create a full video going over that once once it's ready to even show. Uh but I can tell you it's the most excited I've been about something that, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time to build it. And actually, I'm not building it myself. Uh, I'm using a an a a a program to do that. I'll talk about all that in in a later video and do a full full video just explaining uh that that that new thing that I'm working on. But uh either way, I will put a link down below in the in the in the show notes right at the very top to his desktop program because that is phenomenal. that was the base of everything that I'm doing in terms of of being able to actually read speed data. So he did an amazing job of creating the base layer of reading that because Whoop has APIs, Garmin has APIs. Uh asleep does not have an API but someone has had already built it and speeded I used his implementation so or at least that's kind of the basics of it. So, uh, that's really awesome if you want to save money, like if you don't want to, you know, if you don't want to use, uh, everyone asks whenever they get one of these devices. Oh, that's the other big thing I forgot to mention. Sorry, I forgot to mention a huge feature of V3 and 3.1. I mentioned it in the V3 video, but it's for sure official. The popups on your main screen are dead. They took it out. They listened to the community. That's something, by the way, Tonal would have never done if they started implementing popups. If everyone in the community hated them, there's no way they'd get rid of them. You know what I mean? If their membership wasn't forced, right? If their membership was optional. And by the way, they don't even reserve the kind of screen real estate. I mean, right here is the the middle of the screen is where they're reserving screen real estate for that. But they've always had the buttons for doing your actions at the bottom of the screen. So realize like they and and this was my huge critique of Tonal. They moved your action buttons so that they could put the ad. So the action buttons are normally up here on Tonal and when they give you the ad to pay for the membership, they move the action buttons to where they're not normally on the screen. Whereas all your action buttons are down here. And so this is actually not where you'd normally click to do an action. So it's it's actually like even though it's a decent amount of screen real estate and also this piece of screen real estate is super important right with the muscle status and breakdown uh I'm actually trying to rebuild that for myself outside of the speed itself with the data that I have and I don't think I do as good of a job as speed. So, just realize at this point in time, I think their muscle status is actually better than mine. Uh, and you can see my weight is almost 230 lbs. That's why I'm wearing the hoodie today. I'm in full bulk season trying to get as big and as strong and as fast as I can. So, uh, that's, you know, that's where I'm at with with my training. But, yeah, I I would still recommend these devices. I mean, uh, someone had talked about the fit transformer. Not a smart home gym. can't do all the progressive overload, can't do the things that matter to me. You know, is it a great if you're just using freelift mode, would I rather use if you're just using freelift mode, would I rather use the fit transformer than the speed for that? Yeah, probably. Uh, you know, that's the device I I still wouldn't go with that device. I would have for sure went with u the Voltas, which Speedance is putting out a competitor to because it's such a great idea. So realize if it's a great idea, speed expedience will usually do it. I don't think Pilates is a great idea, but I think it was so popular with the tonal community and it sold a lot of tonal twos that you can now do card and you can already do cardio on this machine. That's one where I had a rant in my mind of like don't do cardio on this machine. But the truth of the matter is with rowing, with Pilates now, I mean, this can be a phenomenal cardio machine. And it's kind of a shame that the one that can do all the cardio is up here, and the one that my wife works out on is the one that isn't going to get those features, right? Um, you know, because she would be more likely to take, you know, to take and do them, right, than I will. But I I'm still impressed. Like I'm impressed with these machines to be honest with you. And I think that's the biggest takeaway is am I impressed or am I not impressed? Over a million pounds lifted. Uh let's see where I'm at today. I do like looking at this in every video for whatever reason. So it's the metal count up here. There's a there's a a a piece up top where it shows a bunch of metals, right? And I am at almost one I'm at 1.2 million 1.2 2 million pounds lifted. I'm coming in on 1.5 million pounds lifted to get the next medal. I should hit that. Well, definitely within the month. Yeah, within this month I should be hitting 1.5 million pounds. So, very happy with my progress, very happy with the machine so far. No, no real major issues, you know, no breakages, no downtime with either of them. Uh, you know, I I haven't had the ring problems that everyone has, weirdly enough. Like, for whatever reason, I don't have that issue. Uh, one of my smart handles, one of the four smart handles, cuz I have smart handles on the one downstairs. One of them disconnects more than the rest, and it's this one right here, the right handle. For whatever reason, this one will, especially if it's a very long workout, it will disconnect. Uh, let's see if it's connected right now. See, this one disconnected. They might have both disconnected now. They both disconnected because of the timeout. So there is a timeout on these. They disconnect after so much time and then you can see they reconnect. So now they're both reconnected. Actually, no, only the only the one is reconnected. So give it a second. Now the other one's reconnected. So you can see this one takes a little bit longer to reconnect. It also disconnects a little quicker than the other one. Not really sure, but not not big enough of an issue for me to report it. But it's noticeable that they don't disconnect at the same time that that one dis and it's the only one because I have smart handles downstairs and they don't do that. But this one in particular will disconnect on me. So, it's connected right now. That's what I was checking. But yeah, that's that's all I have for you today. Thank you so much for uh listening. Uh like and subscribe. So, let me know in the comments below if there's anything in particular you want me to talk about on the Spedians. If there's anything you want me to demo, I can do that.
