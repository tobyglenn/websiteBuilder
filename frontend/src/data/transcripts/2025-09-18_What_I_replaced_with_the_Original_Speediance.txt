So, back behind these devices, I actually have what the original Speedians is replacing. So, the original Speedance, I apologize, I didn't unload the weights from these. These are the new bells. These are the 80 lb new bells. These are one of the best adjustable dumbbells on the market, but they're very, you drop them and you're going to break them. So, I also have, and I don't have the weight loaded up on this, thankfully, cuz these go up to 90 lbs. I have the Power Block Elite 90 EXP, which if I want to do carries across the floor and back, you know, these are still going to live on for carries across the floor because it's pretty cool to carry 90 lbs across the floor because that, you know, that's a thing every every guy wants to be able to What?
