The speedian seems a little closer actually, which might make sense because their original range was 0 to 220 and that's actually their 0 to 220 is actually tonals 0 to 200. Like I would imagine they're actually similarish weights. And so their weight is actually closer to what it would feel at 40 lb of a dumbbell, right? So you're you're bicep curling and that 40 lbs is is similarish to the 40 lbs on a dumbbell, but the tonal 40 lb felt like 60 lb. Like it felt super heavy.
