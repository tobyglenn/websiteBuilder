    excerpt: "The device is phenomenal. The company is dreadful. After lifting 9,000,844 pounds on my Tonal and transforming from 250 to 180 pounds, I turned off my membership and found out the hard way what happens when you stop paying.",

    content: "## The Device Is Incredible. The Company Is Not.\n\nI want to be clear about something up front: the Tonal device itself is phenomenal. I transformed my body from over 250 pounds down to 180 pounds using almost nothing but this machine. Every single rep of that transformation — 9,000,844 pounds worth — was logged on Tonal's system.\n\nBut I'm done with Tonal. Not because the device stopped working. Because the company behind it is one of the worst I've ever dealt with.\n\n## The Bar Control Module Incident\n\nAbout two and a half years in, my bar control module started failing. This is the little Bluetooth dongle that lets you control the weight. It stopped working reliably — maybe every third time you'd hit the button and nothing would happen.\n\nI called Tonal expecting them to replace it. This thing costs them probably 30 cents to make. They wanted $60 to $80 to replace it.\n\nKeep in mind I'm paying $63 a month for a membership to use a device I already paid over $5,000 for. I decided not to pay.\n\nA month later, a software update fixed it. Not a word from Tonal. Not an apology. Not a \"hey, sorry we accused you of breaking it.\" Nothing.\n\n## The Membership Price Increase Lie\n\nTonal told everyone they were raising the membership $10 a month due to inflation. That was a lie. It was $10 a month plus sales tax. Depending on where you live, that's actually $15 a month extra. They're still lying about it in their marketing.\n\nThis is consistent with Tonal's behavior. Everything they put in promotional material has lies in it.\n\n## The Buyback Program\n\nTonal launched a buyback program offering $1,000 for your device. Sounds great, right? Except on the exact same day, they had $500 off the device on their website. So they were essentially giving you $500 credit for a device you paid $5,000 for — while you're still paying $63 a month to use it.\n\nI called it the Tonal Steelback Program. The community agreed.\n\n## What Happens When You Turn Off Your Membership\n\nThis is the part that should scare anyone considering Tonal.\n\nI turned off my membership to see what would happen. What happened is this: they moved the workout controls to the top of the screen and replaced the bottom with a giant ad urging you to reactivate. There's no way to start a workout without clicking through to the reactivation page.\n\nAnd the \"access to all your moves\" checkbox on their website without a membership? That's a lie too. Without a membership, you get handles, bar, and rope. That's it. No eccentric mode. No progressive overload. No movement tracking. No weight tracking. Nothing.\n\nPaul Sklar did a review saying you can just do custom workouts without the membership. That's not true. You can't track anything. You can't see your weights. You can't see your sets and reps. It's a husk of a product.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: Paul Sklar's review unit has the membership paid for by Tonal. They all do. That's why you don't see terrible reviews — everyone reviewing Tonal isn't paying for the membership themselves.\n\n## The Cable Replacement\n\nMy cable is frayed. My wife won't even use the machine because she's scared of it. Tonal wants over $300 to replace the cable. On a Speediance, I could replace the cable myself for a fraction of that cost. The Tonal is not user-serviceable.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nTonal built an incredible piece of hardware. They surround it with the worst customer service and business practices I've ever seen in fitness tech.\n\nIf you have any doubt about your ability to pay $63+ a month for the next 5-7 years, don't buy this machine. The device becomes a paperweight with an ad on it the moment you stop paying.\n\nI switched to Speediance. The hardware is comparable. The company actually responds to users. And I don't have a giant ad on my screen every time I want to lift.\n\nIf Tonal wants my business back, they need to earn it. So far, they haven't shown any interest in doing that."

    content: "## The Question That Started It All\n\nSomeone asked me what training split I do. You'd think the answer would be simple — just say push-pull-legs or full body or bro split, right?\n\nBut the real answer is: it depends. And more importantly, the training that built my physique isn't what I do today.\n\nThat's what I want to break down here.\n\n## 2023: Arnold Blueprint PPL\n\nWhen I was driving a steep calorie deficit to go from morbidly obese to fit in six months, I ran the Arnold Blueprint workouts modified for Tonal. That's a push-pull-legs split with a specific structure: 6, 12, 15, and 25 rep sets. The weight drops each round, and Tonal handled all of it automatically.\n\nMonday and Thursday were pushing exercises — skull crushers, bench press, pullovers, incline press, calf raises. Tuesday was pulling. Wednesday and Saturday were legs. Almost every workout got hit, except Wednesdays and Saturdays because I was already fatigued by mid-week.\n\nI did that for four months. Then I dropped the 25-rep sets and did another two months with just 6, 12, 15. That built the physique I have today.\n\n## The Problem With That Approach\n\nHere's the thing nobody talks about: that kind of training is grueling. You're doing 25-rep sets at the end of every workout. You're in a massive calorie deficit. You're training almost every day.\n\nIt's sustainable for a block. It's not sustainable forever.\n\nAfter I built the physique, I asked myself: what now? I didn't want to train that hard forever. I didn't want to live in a calorie deficit forever. I wanted something I could maintain.\n\n## Full Body Minus Legs\n\nThat's when I switched to full body minus legs. I took all my favorite lifts from the Arnold workouts — the ones that felt best, the ones that built the most muscle — and put them into a single workout.\n\nOne warm-up set. One working set to failure on each exercise. Eight to nine exercises in sequence.\n\nThis is what I do now. A typical session hits 41,500 pounds of total volume. Full body, minus legs because if I add legs, I know I'm not going to do the workout.\n\nBut here's the catch: that doesn't work when you have to train every day.\n\n## When Bro Split Saved Me\n\nSpeediance ran a Lunar Challenge — workout every day for a month. My full body minus legs approach was too taxing to do seven days a week. I tried for three days and failed.\n\nSo I switched to a bro split. Dedicated arms day. Dedicated back day. Smaller, targeted sessions in the 10,000-15,000 pound range instead of 40,000.\n\nThe results were immediate. My biceps exploded. When you're hitting 10 arm exercises in a row instead of sprinkling arm work into a full body workout, your muscles notice.\n\nBut the moment the challenge ended, I stopped. Bro split is too time-intensive for my life right now. Two little kids, jiu-jitsu, running — I can't lift every day anymore.\n\n## What I Do Now\n\nFour days a week maximum. Usually three. I go in, hit the machine hard, and get out. No completionism. No forcing every exercise if I'm gassed.\n\nSome days I only get halfway through the working sets before my body says enough. I listen. That's the difference between training to build and training to maintain — you give yourself grace.\n\n## The Real Answer\n\nThe best training split is the one that fits your current situation:\n\n- **Building a physique from scratch?** PPL works. It's grueling but effective.\n- **Already built?** Full body minus legs, 3-4 days a week, is sustainable.\n- **Training every day for a challenge?** Bro split gets the job done.\n\nThe mistake is forcing one approach across different life phases. What got you here won't keep you here. The training has to evolve with your goals, your recovery capacity, and your schedule.\n\nMine has. I'll probably change again next year."

This is a small UI change with outsized impact on real training.\n\n## The Bad: Safety Start Still Limits ROM\nSafety Start continues to restrict your range of motion, which actually makes it dangerous for real lifting. When a machine's \"safety\" feature shortens your range of motion, you lose the eccentric loading benefit that makes these machines worth using. The concentric limiter should help with joint safety without restricting ROM.\n\n## Unilateral Mode Still Buggy\nSingle-arm and single-leg movements still have bugs in the weight reporting and the progressive overload detection. It's a known issue and the community is tracking it.\n\n## What I Want Next\nFix unilateral modes. Restore the original Free Lift partner mode that disappeared in V3. Give us raw motor data for third-party logging. These are all achievable in software — they just need to ship."

I use Garmin specifically for run tracking and have disabled everything else (sleep tracking, body battery, the stress meter) because those metrics are noise.\n\n## What WHOOP Does Well\nHRV-based recovery scoring is the best consumer implementation I've used. When WHOOP says I'm at 35% recovery, my body confirms it. The sleep coaching is also legitimately useful — it tells you exactly how much sleep you need tonight to be recovered by your target wake time.\n\n## The Winner?\nBoth, but for different jobs. Garmin for what you DO, WHOOP for how you RECOVER. The mistake is expecting either one to do both jobs well. They don't."

    content: "## The Number Nobody Told Me About\n\n1,296,447 lbs. That's the total volume I've logged on the Speediance Gym Monster 2S since July 25, 2025. One hundred twenty-five workouts across roughly seven months. I know the exact number because the machine tracks it \u2014 and because I also pull it through my own AI-built fitness dashboard every morning, cross-checking it against WHOOP strain and Garmin data so nothing gets lost in a walled garden.\n\nWhen I hit a million pounds lifted on the device back in late January, I'd already made a video about it. But 1.2 million has a different weight to it \u2014 no pun intended. It's the number where I can actually tell you what's real, what the marketing doesn't cover, and what seven months of serious daily use actually reveals about a piece of fitness technology.\n\nSo let's get into it.\n\n## What the Volume Data Actually Shows\n\nMy best single session was February 2, 2026: **35,305 lbs in 50 minutes**. That's a number that sounds absurd if you've never trained on a digital resistance machine, but it's real \u2014 it's what happens when you're doing 13 reps per set across 15+ exercises with weights in the 80\u2013200 lb range, plus warm-up sets. The machine doesn't let you skip accounting for any of it.\n\nMy top workout program is **Warrior 1**, which I've run 27 times at an average of 18,302 lbs per session. That's the backbone of my upper-body pulling work. Behind that, I rotate through dedicated Back Barbell and Chest Handles programs that I built myself using the custom workout builder \u2014 not the stock programs. The stock programs are fine if you want guided, but they don't match the way I lift, which is one warm-up set at 20 RM for 13 reps, then one working set at 15 RM for 13 reps (with Unlimited Sets turned on so the machine keeps going if I'm pushing beyond the target).\n\nMy exercise PRs from this run:\n- **Barbell lat pulldown:** 294 lbs 1RM (estimated from working weight \u00d7 rep formula)\n- **Seated barbell wide row:** 202 lbs 1RM\n- **Bench press:** 90 lbs via Speediance cable resistance\n\nThe weight gain is real too. I started the Speediance program when my body weight was sitting around 203\u2013205 lbs. As of early 2026, I'm at 218.4 lbs per the Garmin scale \u2014 and I know from the body composition that this isn't fat gain. The transformation from 242 to 188 lbs happened in 2023 and that story is its own post. What the Speediance has done is put me in the strength-build chapter, not the weight-loss chapter.\n\n## The Software: Honest Assessment\n\nI have to be straight with you about this because I've watched too many reviewers gloss over it.\n\nThe V2.x software was solid. Not perfect, but solid. The V3.0 rollout was a mess \u2014 they removed partner mode from Freelift, shipped a broken UI, and added a Safety Start button to my screen that literally did nothing because the firmware for my unit wasn't ready. I sat with a non-functional feature button for weeks.\n\nV3.1 came with the new firmware. The Safety Start now works \u2014 and I've dedicated an entire separate post to why I think it's the wrong solution to the right problem. The short version: it limits your range of motion in exchange for preventing cable retraction into the machine, and the retraction after the firmware update is noticeably slower in ways that concerned me.\n\nWhat they did right in V3.1: they finally prompt you when the machine wants to increase your working weight during bilateral movements. For a long time, it would just silently apply a new heavier weight and you'd hit the cables unprepared. That was the real safety issue \u2014 not whether the cables retract fast enough. V3.1 appears to have fixed it for barbell and dual-handle movements, though I've still caught it misfiring on unilateral exercises.\n\nThe progressive overload logic has also had some strange phases. There was a version where it was overloading users too aggressively (I saw it firsthand \u2014 it set me up for an overhead tricep extension at nearly my overhead press max). Then they overcorrected and it stopped auto-overloading entirely. Right now, you have to manually trigger progression by lifting above the prescribed weight. I actually don't mind this approach \u2014 I prefer to own the decision \u2014 but new users expecting the machine to just handle it will be confused.\n\n## The Processor Upgrade Nobody Talks About\n\nI reached out to the Speediance team directly and asked for the specific processor specs in each machine generation. They confirmed: **the 2S and 2 have a meaningfully upgraded processor from the original**. They don't publish this anywhere. You won't find it on the spec sheet.\n\nThe practical difference is subtle but real. The scrolling on the 2S is noticeably smoother. The loading screen that appears when you hit Start is half a second shorter. Neither of these impacts a workout \u2014 but it explains why some features like Safety Start and the upcoming Pilates integration are only coming to the newer hardware. It's not marketing speak. There are actual compute requirements at play.\n\nI have the original Speediance downstairs and the 2S up in my office. The original is still a great machine \u2014 I do my arms-focused workouts on it all the time because those weights never exceed what it's capable of. If you can find an open-box original at Walmart (I've seen them go for $1,000\u2013$1,500 with full warranty), that's an absurd deal.\n\n## What the Data Actually Changed\n\nHere's the thing I didn't expect from tracking 1.2 million pounds: it changed how I make decisions about training. When I can see that my last three sessions averaged 22,000 lbs and I've had 3.5 hours of sleep (more on that in the WHOOP post), I know that today's session ceiling is probably 12,000 lbs and I should adjust before I start \u2014 not halfway through when I'm gassed.\n\nThe challenges Speediance runs on the platform have also meaningfully changed my programming. The Lunar Flow challenge forced me to rethink high-volume sessions. Before it, my typical session was a full upper-body day at 30,000\u201340,000 lbs that required a recovery day after. The challenge pushed me to develop smaller, targeted daily sessions. I found I actually like both formats now and alternate between them.\n\nOne real frustration: the partner mode situation. My wife works out on the machine downstairs and I'm upstairs. We cannot do a custom workout together. We cannot count her lifts against her profile if we work out side by side. This has been the number-one community request for two years. Tonal had it from day one. I understand V3.0 broke what little partner mode existed, V3.1 partially brought it back, but the right version \u2014 logged-in profiles, custom workouts, dual-load that actually tracks both people \u2014 doesn't exist yet.\n\nThat's the thing about the Speediance. It's genuinely great. It's also still maturing, and if you expect it to just work perfectly the way consumer products are supposed to, you'll be disappointed at least occasionally. If you treat it like what it actually is \u2014 sophisticated training hardware with active firmware development and a responsive team \u2014 you'll be fine.\n\nAfter 1,296,447 lbs, I'm still on it every day I can be. That's the real verdict."

    content: "## The Morning Read\n\nFebruary 11, 2026. I wake up and before I touch a barbell or think about the mat, I check three things in this order:\n\n1. WHOOP recovery score\n2. 8Sleep score\n3. My AI morning fitness report\n\nThat morning: **WHOOP recovery 18%**. HRV at 18.7ms. Total sleep logged at 3.5 hours. WHOOP strain from the previous day at 11.6.\n\nThe 8Sleep Pod came in at **61 out of 100** for sleep score \u2014 independently confirming what WHOOP was telling me. Two different sleep tracking technologies, neither with any reason to agree with each other, and they're both pointing at the same thing: I had a rough night.\n\nMy AI system's morning report flagged it immediately: **Active Recovery recommended, 77.8% confidence. Weighted score: 55.65. Sleep debt flagged.** Injury risk elevated.\n\nHere's what I actually do with that information.\n\n## What 18% Actually Means\n\nFirst, let's be precise about what WHOOP recovery is measuring. The score is primarily driven by HRV, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep performance. HRV \u2014 heart rate variability \u2014 is the main signal. At 18.7ms, mine was significantly below my recent baseline. Low HRV means the autonomic nervous system is under stress: the parasympathetic (rest/recovery) branch isn't dominating the way it should be first thing in the morning.\n\nThe WHOOP strain score from the day before was 11.6. That's a moderate day \u2014 not a grinder, but not nothing. Combined with only 3.5 hours of sleep, my body was carrying unresolved training stress into the morning without having done the recovery work.\n\nEighteen percent puts you in what WHOOP calls the red zone. Their recommendation at that level is rest or very light activity. I've had enough red days to know that the score is not telling you you're broken \u2014 it's telling you the system is running on reserves.\n\n## The Decision Tree\n\nHere's the exact order I work through it:\n\n**Step 1 \u2014 Is there a structural reason for the low score?**\nSometimes a red day has a clear cause: I stayed up until 2am, I had a terrible night from stress, I flew somewhere. On February 11, I knew why. No mystery. That actually makes the decision easier \u2014 it's not a health flag, it's an input flag. The math just didn't add up for recovery that night.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 What does the 8Sleep say?**\nI wear both a WHOOP and sleep on an 8Sleep Pod, and they don't always agree. When they disagree significantly, I dig deeper. When they agree \u2014 like February 11, where both independently said the night was bad \u2014 I trust the convergence more than either device alone. A 61/100 on 8Sleep with 18% on WHOOP is a clear signal. I'm not going to talk myself out of it.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 What's on the training schedule?**\nFebruary 11 had a scheduled recovery run and a potential BJJ evening session. The AI recommendation was Active Recovery. My own read of the data matched it. I went ahead with the recovery run \u2014 1.38 miles at a 13:12/mile pace, average HR 117. Zone 1, barely there. Not a workout. A movement session. I skipped the evening BJJ.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 What did I actually eat?**\nCalories logged: 792 kcal. Protein: 78g. On a red day, underfeeding makes everything worse. 792 kcal is under-maintenance for someone at my body weight training this volume. The AI flagged this too \u2014 low caloric intake on a sleep-debt day compounds recovery suppression. I added a meal in the evening.\n\n## What I Don't Do On a Red Day\n\nI don't test maxes. I don't go into a Warrior 1 workout at full working weight. I don't spar hard at BJJ \u2014 because the risk profile changes when recovery is this low. In jiu-jitsu specifically, reaction time degrades when you're sleep-deprived. You're more likely to get into bad positions you can't read fast enough to escape, and the injury risk from fatigue isn't just about muscles \u2014 it's about decision-making speed on the mat.\n\nI also don't panic. One 18% day doesn't unwind months of training. The mistake is training through it at full intensity and then wondering why you're beat up two days later.\n\n## The AI System's Role\n\nThe recommendation \u2014 Active Recovery, 77.8% confidence, weighted score 55.65 \u2014 comes from my OpenClaw-built fitness assistant that runs every morning before I wake up. It pulls from WHOOP, Garmin, 8Sleep, Speediance workout history, and calorie data. It runs a weighted scoring model across those inputs and outputs a training recommendation with a confidence level and specific flags.\n\nThe \"77.8% confidence\" on Active Recovery means the model sees conflicting signals \u2014 not everything points the same direction. The previous day's strain of 11.6 wasn't high enough on its own to demand rest. But combined with 3.5 hours of sleep, HRV that's well below baseline, and an 8Sleep score of 61, it lands on Active Recovery and surfaces the sleep debt as the primary driver.\n\nI don't follow it blindly. But it's right more often than I am when I'm trying to rationalize a training session my body isn't ready for.\n\n## The Real Test\n\nThe honest measurement of a recovery protocol isn't how you feel after one red day \u2014 it's whether your training trend over weeks and months keeps moving up. My Speediance volume data says it is. My Garmin running data says it is (I'll get into that in the Garmin post). The transformation from 242 lbs to where I am now didn't happen by ignoring red days. It happened by executing hard on green and yellow days, and actually resting on red ones.\n\nAn 18% WHOOP score is the machine's way of telling you the same thing a good coach would: *not today*. The data's been right every time I listened to it."

    content: "## What Speediance Called a Safety Feature\n\nWhen Speediance rolled out V3.0 and then V3.1, one of the headlining additions was something they called **Safety Start**. The name implies it's protecting you. The marketing implied it was a long-requested safety feature, especially for users who were concerned about the cables suddenly engaging at high weight and pulling them into the machine.\n\nI've now had the V3.1 firmware running on my 2S for weeks, and I have a specific, data-informed opinion: **Safety Start is the wrong solution to the right problem, and the way it was implemented created a different problem that's arguably worse.**\n\nLet me walk you through exactly what it does and why I don't use it.\n\n## What Safety Start Actually Does\n\nHere's the mechanical reality. When you activate Safety Start, you pull the cable out to a specific position, hold it there, and hit confirm. The machine then locks that cable length as the minimum retraction point. The cable will not retract further than where you set it for the duration of your set.\n\nThe intent: if you're doing a fly or a cable cross, the cable won't suddenly snap back toward the machine and pull you with it when you're near the machine at the end of a rep. For certain movements where a user is close to the frame at full extension, you can see why someone asked for this.\n\nThe problem is what they had to do to the cable retraction system to make it work: **they slowed down the retraction speed across the entire machine.** Not just when Safety Start is active. Always.\n\nI noticed it the day I got the new firmware. When I bring a cable back toward the machine, it now moves noticeably more slowly than it did on V2.x. If I pull a cable out and then release it quickly \u2014 something that happens naturally when you're done with a set and letting the handle swing back \u2014 there's now visible slack in the cord. I showed this in my V3.1 video: the cord literally folding into itself when I transition from a high anchor point (L0) to a low anchor point (L7) with the firmware-modified retraction speed. That's not a feature. That's cable wear waiting to happen.\n\nThe machine downstairs \u2014 my original Speediance, which didn't get the 2S-specific firmware \u2014 still retracts the way it always did. The difference is noticeable the moment you go from one to the other.\n\n## The Range of Motion Problem\n\nNow here's the part that actually matters for your training.\n\nSafety Start sets a fixed cable length. That fixed length becomes your maximum extension. Which means **it caps your range of motion at whatever point you set it**.\n\nI watched a user online demonstrate using Safety Start on basically every single exercise in their workout. When I looked at their range of motion on cable flyes, they were getting maybe 60% of the stretch I get on the same movement. The cable was locked before full extension. That means incomplete eccentric stretch, limited mechanical tension at the end-range, and \u2014 most critically \u2014 a false sense of what that movement is actually training.\n\nFor general fitness users doing moderate weights, this might not register as a problem. For someone doing jiu-jitsu, it's a real issue. The position that gets me in trouble on the mat isn't the midrange of any movement \u2014 it's the locked-out, fully extended position. My arm getting controlled at full extension. My shoulder getting loaded at maximum stretch. That's precisely the range of motion I need to be *strengthening*, not locking out of.\n\nMy training philosophy \u2014 eccentric mode cranked to near-maximum, slow controlled return, full range of motion on every rep \u2014 is specifically designed to build strength and resilience at the extremes. Safety Start is directly opposed to that.\n\n## The Actual Bug People Were Trying to Fix\n\nHere's the context that explains why this feature exists. Before V3.1, there was a real bug in the Speediance software: it would sometimes apply a weight update mid-workout without warning, particularly on unilateral (one-arm) movements. The machine would think you'd set a PR on one side and suddenly apply a heavier weight to the other side without prompting you. Users were getting thrown off-balance or pulled into positions they weren't ready for.\n\nThat's the bug Safety Start was trying to address \u2014 people were using it as a workaround to prevent being surprised by sudden weight changes.\n\nV3.1 appears to have actually fixed the underlying bug for bilateral movements. When the machine wants to increase weight during a barbell or dual-handle movement, it now prompts you and lets you accept or decline. That's the right fix. The bug remains in unilateral movements, and that's where they still need to do work \u2014 but for the majority of use cases, the real problem is now properly addressed in software.\n\nWhich makes Safety Start a solution in search of the problem it was designed to solve.\n\n## What I Use Instead\n\nHere's my actual setup:\n\n**For range-of-motion protection:** Full retraction. I pull the cable out, position myself, turn on the weight, and go. I bring it back slowly at the end of the set, maintaining tension all the way to the machine. The 1-second pause at the machine turns the weight off reliably \u2014 it has never failed to do so for me across over a million pounds lifted.\n\n**For weight surprise prevention:** I have both 1RM settings set to \"both sides jointly using the latest 1RM\" in Training Preferences. This keeps left and right arms at matching weights. I also have Unlimited Sets turned on, which means the machine doesn't auto-increment weight just because I did extra reps \u2014 I control when I want to test a new max.\n\n**For the retraction issue created by the firmware:** I'm working around it by being deliberate about transitions. When I go from a high to a low anchor point, I manually guide the cable down rather than letting it swing. It's a minor annoyance. I'm hoping a future firmware update brings the retraction speed back to where it was before.\n\n**For situations where a cable might actually pull me into the machine:** I use the one-second pause, I keep my stance accounted for relative to the frame, and I train with eccentric mode engaged so the resistance profile is predictable throughout the rep. Those things matter more than a cable length lock.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nIf you bought the Speediance 2S and you're using Safety Start on every movement, you are capping your range of motion and leaving performance on the table. The retraction behavior it required also introduced a legitimate issue that Speediance needs to fix in a future firmware update.\n\nTurn it off. Fix your stance relative to the machine. Trust the one-second pause. And if you're worried about weight surprises, stay in the dynamic weight modes (Stamina, Gain Muscle, Strength) instead of using the Customize input box \u2014 that's where the machine's intelligence actually lives.\n\nThe irony of Safety Start is that the truly safe way to use the Speediance \u2014 full eccentric loading, controlled return, proper positioning \u2014 doesn't require it at all."

    content: "## The Setup People Always Ask About\n\nEvery time I post a workout breakdown or a recovery analysis, someone asks: why do you wear both a Garmin and a WHOOP? Isn't that redundant? Don't they track the same things?\n\nNo. They don't. And understanding why is more important than the devices themselves.\n\nHere's the framework I've settled on after wearing both simultaneously for over a year:\n\n**Garmin = what you DID.** \n**WHOOP = how you RECOVERED.**\n\nThose are different questions. They require different hardware. Conflating them leads to making training decisions off the wrong data.\n\n## What the Garmin Is Actually Tracking\n\nI have the Garmin Forerunner 265S. I chose the S specifically because I knew I'd want to sleep with it on to enable the daily suggested workout feature, which requires overnight wear. Smaller form factor, lighter, less wrist fatigue. I came from a Fenix (the bigger one) and I don't miss the weight.\n\nWhat I actually use the Garmin for:\n\n**GPS-locked activity data.** Over the past year \u2014 February 2025 through February 2026 \u2014 I've logged **111 runs and 265.1 miles** through Garmin. That dataset is clean, timestamped, GPS-verified for outdoor runs and cadence-verified for treadmill sessions. I know exactly what I've done because Garmin writes it down precisely.\n\nMy running started at a 1.02-mile treadmill session in February 2025. My longest run to date is 5.00 miles \u2014 a tempo run on June 30, 2025. My monthly peak volume was June 2025 at 76.8 miles across 24 runs. I'm currently in a race prep block (there's a local 4-mile race coming) and running 15+ sessions per month again.\n\nNone of that data comes from WHOOP. WHOOP doesn't do GPS. It doesn't log route data. It doesn't measure pace or cadence with the specificity Garmin does. When I want to know whether my 3.86-mile treadmill run averaged 14:00/mile at 130 HR \u2014 I'm reading the Garmin log.\n\n**Workout-by-workout heart rate structure.** The Garmin gives me time in HR zones for every session. That March 15, 2025 outdoor run \u2014 which was the Lucky Charm race \u2014 maxed at 192 bpm with significant time in zones 4 and 5. That's race-effort data. A recovery run on February 11 averaged 117 bpm and stayed almost entirely in zone 1. The zone breakdown is how I verify that easy days are actually easy.\n\n**Activity tracking for the AI system.** My OpenClaw fitness dashboard pulls Garmin data as one of six connectors. The Garmin history gives the morning report context on running volume, training load accumulation, and how that interacts with the WHOOP and Speediance data.\n\n## What the WHOOP Is Actually Tracking\n\nWHOOP 4.0, worn on my wrist \u2014 and also in a bicep band or underwear when I'm rolling at BJJ, because a chest strap during jiu-jitsu is a miserable experience. The wrist option works fine for BJJ, though the bicep band gives better accuracy.\n\nWHOOP doesn't care about GPS. It's not trying to log your run splits. What it does:\n\n**HRV and overnight physiology.** The core WHOOP measurement is overnight HRV, resting heart rate, and respiratory rate. These are the inputs to the recovery score. HRV in particular \u2014 the variation between heartbeats \u2014 is the most sensitive indicator of autonomic nervous system state I've found. When it drops, something happened: too little sleep, too much training stress, alcohol, sickness, whatever.\n\n**Recovery scoring with context.** The recovery percentage synthesizes the overnight data into a single actionable number. When I woke up on February 11 at 18% recovery with an HRV of 18.7ms, that number came from WHOOP tracking my body's physiological state through the night. Garmin was also on my wrist that night \u2014 but Garmin Connect still says \"calibrating\" on its readiness metrics. For right now, WHOOP is doing the heavy lifting on recovery intelligence.\n\n**Strain from activities that don't have GPS.** This is actually where things get interesting. Until recently, my Speediance workouts weren't being counted toward my WHOOP daily strain at all. I was manually logging them, and they counted for almost nothing. Then Speediance started writing calorie data to Apple Health, and WHOOP picked it up and began modifying the strain score accordingly. My lifting sessions went from contributing near-zero strain to contributing 10+ strain points. My daily totals are now accurate in a way they weren't before.\n\n## Where They Disagree \u2014 And What I Do\n\nThey don't always agree on sleep. My 8Sleep Pod is a third data source, and on some nights all three tell a different story. The Garmin might log 7 hours, the WHOOP logs 5.5, the 8Sleep scores it a 74.\n\nWhen WHOOP and 8Sleep diverge, I look at the HRV number specifically. HRV doesn't lie in the same way duration estimates can. Duration numbers depend on how each device defines \"sleep\" versus \"restfulness\" \u2014 and that varies between platforms. HRV is a physiological signal that doesn't have the same definitional ambiguity. If my HRV is low, I'm not recovered, regardless of how many hours the Garmin thinks I slept.\n\nWhen Garmin and WHOOP disagree on effort \u2014 Garmin shows a high-intensity workout but WHOOP's strain is low \u2014 it's almost always because WHOOP missed some of the activity (Speediance doesn't write to Apple Health fully, or the BJJ session data wasn't captured properly). That's a data pipeline issue, not a sensor issue. I fix it by making sure the sync pathways are working.\n\n## The WHOOP 5 Question\n\nPeople ask me constantly about upgrading to WHOOP 5. My take: the hardware is not actually smaller in any way that matters. They made it narrower and thinner in the band dimension \u2014 the two dimensions that don't affect comfort \u2014 while making it thicker off the wrist, which is the only dimension that matters. None of the WHOOP 4 bands fit. You need a spacer in the underwear accessory to make the sizing work. It feels like an intentional incompatibility move.\n\nMy WHOOP 4.0 works. The data is solid. I'm not upgrading until there's a meaningful sensor improvement.\n\n## The Framework in Practice\n\nThe decision tree is simple:\n\n- **Checking run pace, distance, HR zones by session?** \u2192 Garmin\n- **Deciding how hard to train today?** \u2192 WHOOP recovery score, confirmed by 8Sleep\n- **Evaluating week-over-week training load trend?** \u2192 Both, through the AI dashboard\n- **Understanding why I feel bad today?** \u2192 WHOOP HRV trend over the past 7 days\n- **Logging a race or structured run?** \u2192 Garmin is the source of truth\n\nThese tools are not competitors. They're measuring different things on different time horizons. Using both \u2014 properly \u2014 gives you a more complete picture than either one alone. The key is knowing which question each device is actually qualified to answer."

    excerpt: "A user online claimed the Speediance 2S can't do 260 lbs outside of Free Lift. He was dead wrong — and proving it live sent me down a rabbit hole into how the PR and progressive overload system actually works under the hood.",

    content: "## The Claim That Sent Me Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nSomeone online bought a Speediance 2S and then posted that the machine was incapable of doing 260 lbs outside of Free Lift mode. He'd gone in, hit Customize, tried to enter 260, and the machine bumped him back down to 220. Based on that single interaction, he was threatening a chargeback. The machine was, he said, totally broken.\n\nI'd shown 260 lbs on the machine in previous videos — specifically on the deadlift, which is the one lift where I'd push to the machine's ceiling — but only in Free Lift mode. So I couldn't just say he was wrong without proving it. More importantly, I realized I didn't fully understand the 1RM calculation system myself. I knew *that* it worked. I didn't know *exactly how*.\n\nSo I set up the camera and tried to figure it out live.\n\n## The Customize Box Is Not How You Lift Heavy\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you when you buy one of these machines: **the Customize input box caps you at 220 lbs by design.** That's not a bug. That's a deliberate ceiling on manually-entered weight. If you go into any workout, tap Customize, and try to type in 260, the machine resets you to 220.\n\nThe dynamic weight modes — Gain Muscle, Stamina, Strength — do not have this cap. They use your 1RM estimate to calculate your working weight for each exercise, and if your 1RM is established above 220 lbs, the machine will serve up a working weight above 220 lbs automatically. No manual entry required.\n\nSo the user's error was using Customize when he should have been letting the dynamic modes do the math. The machine will never offer you a working weight it doesn't think you can handle based on your established 1RM. He just hadn't established his 1RM yet.\n\n## How the 1RM Gets Set\n\nThis is where it gets interesting, and where I had to actually experiment to understand what was happening.\n\nI have a deadlift custom workout: one set at 9RM for 12 reps. My most recent working weight had been 225 lbs. On the stats screen, clicking through the workout and into the individual barbell deadlift exercise, I can see my 1RM estimate: **293 lbs**, calculated from 195 lbs for 13 reps using the standard 1RM formula.\n\nBut I also had a workout entry showing two dashes — no PR — from a session where I'd set the weight to 260 and done 3 reps instead of the prescribed 12. That gap made me suspicious: did the machine refuse to calculate a 1RM above 220, even in dynamic modes?\n\nThe answer, which I confirmed live on camera: **no**. The machine calculates 1RM from any weight in dynamic mode. The reason I got dashes was because I didn't do the prescribed number of reps. I did 3 instead of 12. The machine treats extra reps or too-few reps as a non-event — it doesn't penalize you, but it also doesn't update your 1RM unless you hit approximately the prescribed rep count at the new weight.\n\nSo I put my mouth guard in — yes, I actually wear a mouth guard for max lifts, I chew on my lip otherwise — cranked the weight to 260 lbs, and deadlifted 12 reps on camera. The new 1RM read: **388 lbs**. The machine calculated it correctly and immediately. The deadlift PR updated. The user's machine wasn't broken. He just had no established 1RM and was using the wrong input method.\n\n## The Progressive Overload Logic (And Its Current State)\n\nThis is where I want to spend more time, because it explains a lot of confusion in the community.\n\nThe Speediance progressive overload system has gone through several phases in the software. The version I was running when I shot this video had effectively **turned off automatic progressive overload entirely**. I noticed it because I was doing the same workout three times in a row, doing more reps each time, and nothing was changing — the machine wasn't bumping my working weight up.\n\nHere's the mechanic: doing additional reps above the prescribed number does *not* trigger a 1RM update. Never has, across any software version. If you're supposed to do 13 reps and you do 16, those extra 3 reps don't count toward your PR. This is different from how Tonal worked — on Tonal, doing extra reps would re-calculate your strength estimate and potentially overload your next session. Some people liked that; I actually don't.\n\nOn Speediance, the only way to record a new 1RM is to do approximately the prescribed rep count at a higher weight. That's it. The machine doesn't track your volume progression and extrapolate from it. You have to intentionally test a higher weight and do the reps.\n\nThe reason automatic overload seems to have been turned off in this software version is almost certainly community backlash. There was a previous version where the machine was overloading people too aggressively — I personally saw a working weight suggestion that would have been my overhead press max applied to a tricep exercise. It was insane. Someone hit stop. Speediance overcorrected, and now you have to manually drive your own progression.\n\nI actually don't hate this. The approach I use is: train with Unlimited Sets turned on, accumulate reps above the prescribed amount until I feel like the weight is genuinely easy, then schedule a dedicated PR attempt where I set the weight to my target and do the prescribed rep count cleanly. The new 1RM locks in and drives all my working weights up across every exercise in the workout on the next session.\n\n## The Lunar Flow Lesson\n\nWhile I was running through this, I was also mid-way through the Lunar Flow challenge on the Speediance platform — working out every day for a set period to hit Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers. I was at Bronze because I'd missed a couple days and a lot of people had blown past me.\n\nThat challenge changed something about the way I program. My previous sessions were enormous: 30,000 to 40,000 lbs, full upper-body-except-legs, required a recovery day after. To hit the challenge every day, I had to create smaller, more targeted sessions. A dedicated arms day. A dedicated back day. Volume in the 10,000–15,000 lb range instead of 40,000.\n\nAnd I found I actually liked it. Both formats have a place now. The challenge forced me to develop variety I didn't know I wanted.\n\nThe 60-something-year-old user in the community who beat me to the previous volume challenge by five or six days? That motivated me more than I'd like to admit. Some people just get after it regardless of age, body type, or physique. The machine's leaderboard makes that visible in a way a private home gym never would.\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nIf you're using Customize to enter weights on the Speediance, you're using the wrong tool for anything above 220 lbs. The dynamic modes are where the machine's intelligence lives. Get in, let it calculate your working weights from your established 1RM, and let the system do its job.\n\nIf you want to push the ceiling — 260 lbs on the deadlift, 294 lbs on the lat pulldown, whatever your goal is — you do it by establishing the 1RM through the dynamic modes and actually lifting the prescribed reps at the new weight. The machine will record it. Your working weights will climb accordingly on the next session.\n\nAnd put your mouth guard in."

    content: "## Why I'm Even Talking About This\n\nI'm a brown belt. I've competed. I've coached. I've rolled with people across a significant range of skill levels from white belt through black belt. When a controversy like this surfaces — is Mike Israetel actually a black belt? — I have something most of the people commenting on it don't have: a frame of reference that isn't just watching YouTube clips.\n\nI also have something more specific than that. I actually saw Mike Israetel at a competition when he was a brown belt, about three years ago. Not just a video. In person. I was coaching one of my guys at a tournament in the mid-Atlantic — DC or Maryland area, where everyone from the Northeast ends up eventually — and Israetel was there with his coach.\n\nSo let me tell you what I actually saw, and then let me tell you why the internet's hot take is, in my view, mostly wrong.\n\n## What I Saw in Person\n\nIsraetel was wearing a rash guard that signaled his rank — brown belt at the time. His coach was standing next to him. Both of them were, and I say this with complete sincerity, absolute units of human beings. I've been to the Arnold Classic. I've been around big people. I've never seen someone that short and that wide. His coach was a leaner, more muscular version of the same general body type — and the coach had a competitor entered in the no-gi division who ended up rolling against the guy I brought.\n\nI brought a white belt. A talented white belt — someone with around 60 wins at white belt, which was enough to get him pushed up to compete in the blue belt division. Still a white belt, but genuinely skilled.\n\nWe lost. Not close. His coach's student handled us. And that's the most important data point in this entire discussion. If a coach is running a black belt mill — just handing out belts based on time in grade and tuition paid — his blue belts don't look like that. They don't go into competition and dominate talented white-belt-class competitors. The teaching is either working or it isn't. Based on what I saw from that one student, the teaching is working.\n\n## The Greg Doucette Take Was Just Wrong\n\nI'll be direct about this. Greg Doucette made a video going after Israetel's jiu-jitsu, using the Johnny Shreve sparring footage as evidence. His argument: it took Israetel over three and a half minutes to \"take out\" Shreve, which he presented as evidence of poor skill.\n\nAnyone who trains jiu-jitsu can identify several problems with this analysis.\n\nFirst, that footage is *sparring*, not a match. Israetel is visibly goofing around in portions of it. He's using unusual sweeps, trying different positions, being playful. This is what high-level practitioners do in low-stakes rolls. If I rolled with a white belt and spent the whole time trying to hit a berimbolo, you could film it and make me look terrible. That wouldn't mean I couldn't submit them in ten seconds if I decided to.\n\nSecond, Johnny Shreve is not small. Not by any measure. Doucette claimed Israetel outweighed him by 50 pounds in that video. I don't think that's true. Shreve is a big, strong guy. Rolling with someone his size — at Israetel's weight — and \"taking three and a half minutes\" while trying advanced techniques and having fun is not an indictment of your belt. It's sparring.\n\nThird — and this is the one that really matters — when your cardio starts going and you're a heavy guy, you get sloppier. That's not a belt level critique. That's a cardiovascular fitness critique. Those are different things. You can be a legitimate black belt and also not be in competition-ready shape. I've experienced this firsthand.\n\n## The Ariel Helwani Take Was Worse\n\nHelwani commented — in reference to Derek Moneyberg, not Israetel specifically — that anyone should be able to last 30 seconds against Gordon Ryan. The implication being that Moneyberg's claim of not lasting 30 seconds against Nicky Ryan (who Helwani seemed to conflate with Gordon) was ridiculous.\n\nHelwani has been commentating MMA and covering grappling for years. If you've done that for years and you still think a recreational practitioner should be able to last 30 seconds against Gordon Ryan in a jiu-jitsu match, you don't understand jiu-jitsu.\n\nGordon Ryan has submitted world champions in under 30 seconds. His ability to take the match to the ground, establish a position, and finish is not comparable to anything in the MMA context where you could theoretically circle and survive for 30 seconds. In pure jiu-jitsu, if Gordon Ryan decides the match is over, it's over in seconds. Full stop.\n\nHe's thinking about it like an MMA commentator: you can dance around, tie up, create chaos, survive. Jiu-jitsu doesn't give you those outs once someone at that level gets a hold of you. And he should know this.\n\n## The Craig Jones Principle\n\nCraig Jones has talked publicly about something I think applies directly here. At seminars, he'll go through a line of practitioners to roll with — purples, browns, and blacks tend to put themselves at the front, because they want to test themselves against the best version of him when he's fresh. Blues sometimes put themselves at the end of the line.\n\nThat end-of-line blue belt, Craig says, is the one he's wary of. Fresh against a tired Craig Jones, with the specific goal of winning, that person is dangerous. And sometimes they win.\n\nThis is Craig Jones — one of the top five jiu-jitsu practitioners on the planet — acknowledging he can be beaten by a blue belt under specific circumstances. So for anyone to call Mike Israetel \"upper blue belt level\" as a critique, understand what they're actually saying: they're saying he's at the level where, on a bad day, he could lose to a blue belt. Which is true of literally everyone outside the top ten in the world.\n\n## My Own Competition Context\n\nI competed recently — first tournament back after my second child. I went in without a proper training camp, banged up, and with less competition prep than I've done at any previous belt level. Here's what happened:\n\nIn the absolute no-gi cash prize division, I got launched off the mat and onto the concrete on the very first exchange. The guy started the takedown from inside the circle, launched me, and I literally landed on concrete. No damage, restarted, kept going. Lost that match in overtime because I gassed — he was in competition shape, I wasn't, and overtime is first-takedown-wins, which strongly favors the guy whose cardio is intact.\n\nI also won two matches with submissions, including hitting my reverse triangle from the receiving end of a north-south choke attempt — a late-match desperation move that I've drilled specifically because I knew it could work in that scramble.\n\nPoint being: even with a broken finger going in and no training camp, I can show flashes of the technical level I've built over years of training. Taking the wrong clip of any of those matches and analyzing it out of context would make me look like an upper blue belt on some exchanges and like a brown belt on others.\n\nThat's how jiu-jitsu works. You need sustained footage of someone actually trying, across different opponents, at different levels of fatigue. Not a sparring clip from a YouTube video where they're visibly playing around.\n\n## The Moneyberg Distinction\n\nHere's where I'll separate the two cases. Derek Moneyberg's black belt in three years — without any competition — deserves more scrutiny than what Israetel has received. Three years is exceptionally fast. BJ Penn got a black belt quickly and he's arguably one of the greatest jiu-jitsu players in MMA history. That's the standard you're implicitly holding yourself to when you take a black belt that fast without competition results.\n\nMike Israetel reportedly trained for around ten years to get his black belt. That timeline, plus the footage of him in live rolls, plus what I saw in person at that competition — his coach's caliber, his coach's student's caliber — doesn't add up to a fraudulent promotion. It adds up to a heavy guy who's legitimately skilled and not in competition shape.\n\nThose are not the same thing. And the internet keeps confusing them."

    content: "## The Comment That Made Me Record This Video\n\nSomeone left a comment on one of my Speediance videos: they were going to buy the original machine, and once they had a physique like mine, they'd upgrade to the Gym Monster 2S. It was a compliment, and I appreciated it. But it stopped me cold.\n\nBecause if I let that comment sit without a response, I'm doing the same thing every other fitness influencer does: posting results without context and letting people assume it was hard work and consistency alone. I've watched enough of those creators get exposed to know exactly what that looks like from the outside. I'm not doing it.\n\nSo here's everything. The full protocol. Every pharmaceutical, every data point, every calorie. This is how I went from 242 lbs to 188 lbs between June and December of 2023.\n\n## First: I've Never Done This Naturally\n\nThis is the realization that prompted me to record the video in the first place. When I was talking to my wife about this transformation, I realized something: I have never transformed my physique naturally. Not once.\n\nIn high school, I went from being a fat kid to a relatively fit senior year. I thought that was willpower and effort. It wasn't. I was using phentermine — which was over-the-counter at the time and available online. I just didn't think of it as a drug because I was a teenager and it was easy to get.\n\nThe transformation before 2023? Same thing — phentermine, plus running. I credited the running. I had a partner at the time who was posting about her transformation publicly without mentioning that the entire thing was done on a prescription appetite suppressant. That bothered me then and it bothers me now. You can't tell people you achieved something naturally when you didn't. They'll try to replicate it and fail, and they'll think the failure is their fault.\n\nSo: my 2023 transformation, like every transformation I've ever done, used pharmaceutical support. Now let me tell you exactly what that looked like.\n\n## The Stack (All Prescribed, All Through Doctors)\n\n**TRT — restructured protocol.** I've been on testosterone replacement therapy for years. My levels were low — a symptom I traced back to a broken testicle from a farm accident that I couldn't get looked at immediately because I didn't have health insurance at the time. I found out about the damage during a vasectomy procedure years later.\n\nThe issue wasn't my TRT dose — it was the administration schedule. My previous protocol had me doing intramuscular injections infrequently, which created blood serum spikes and valleys. The new doctor — Matrix, now Matrix Reformed — switched me to subcutaneous injections three times per week at the same total dose. The more stable serum levels changed how I felt dramatically. That alone wouldn't have driven the weight loss, but it laid the foundation.\n\n**Tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP agonist).** I specifically requested tirzepatide over semaglutide because the gastric side effect profile was better in the literature. I never had a single GI issue throughout the entire protocol — not at the lowest dose, not at the highest. The hunger suppression was real. I have an insatiable appetite normally — the kind of hunger signaling that makes counting calories feel like running against a tide. Tirzepatide turned that signal down to something I could work with.\n\nThe timing of hunger spikes on a weekly injection schedule is interesting. The half-life is approximately 5 days, so you'd expect peak hunger on day 5. For me, it was days 3 through 5 — variable. Never the day of injection, never the day after, never the day before the next injection.\n\n**Anavar (oral anabolic).** This is where it gets more unconventional and where I want to be precise about why it was included. My stated goal to the doctor was: lose 50+ lbs in six months without losing a single ounce of muscle. That's an aggressive body recomposition goal. With a significant caloric deficit of this magnitude over this duration, even with TRT, muscle loss is a real risk. Anavar was included specifically as a muscle-preservation protocol. Looking back at the progress photos, it worked — the muscle retention was better than any previous cut I've done.\n\n**Tadalafil.** Yes, the erectile dysfunction medication. The mechanism that matters here isn't the primary use case — it's that tadalafil is a vasodilator. In the context of training, it increases blood flow and pump during workouts. I know how that sounds. I can tell you it was a genuine motivator during a period when I was training at a massive caloric deficit. Seeing immediate evidence that your muscles are responding to the work — even when you're running on 1,000 calories — keeps you going. Of any item on this stack, it has the highest safety profile and the most widely-studied data.\n\n## The Data: Calories, Steps, Volume\n\nHere's where this transformation becomes incomprehensible to most people who haven't done something similar.\n\n**Calories, 6 days a week: 800–1,200.** That's it. That's the number. Six days a week, I was eating between 800 and 1,200 calories. One day per week was unrestricted — but it couldn't be more often than every 7 days, and I tried to stretch it to every 10 or so. I could not have sustained this caloric intake without the tirzepatide. I don't get full, and I'm chronically hungry. On 800 calories without pharmaceutical hunger suppression, I would have failed by day three.\n\n**Steps: minimum 10,000, reality closer to 20,000.** I have insomnia, and it gets worse at low calories. Every night I couldn't sleep, I went downstairs, got on the treadmill, and played video games until I was tired enough to go back to bed. This wasn't scheduled cardio. This was insomnia management that happened to stack additional daily steps. Most nights it pushed me well above the 10K minimum.\n\n**Lifting volume: 30,000 to 50,000 lbs daily.** This is the number that sounds impossible until you understand what it means in practice. At a Speediance or functional trainer, doing multiple exercises, multiple sets at relatively moderate weight with controlled reps — 30,000 lbs is achievable. It required a significant time commitment during a winter where my kids were too young for activities and it was too cold to be outside. I calculated that window and I used it.\n\n## The Timeline\n\n- **June 2023:** 242 lbs. Starting point.\n- **August 4:** 230 lbs. Protocol started in mid-July.\n- **September 7:** 220 lbs.\n- **October:** 213 lbs.\n- **November:** 202 lbs.\n- **December:** 200 lbs. (Slower month — Thanksgiving. Also the month I briefly went off TRT while transitioning from the clinic to an endocrinologist.)\n- **Target achieved by March 2024:** Under 190, with six-pack abs at six feet tall.\n\nThe brief TRT-off period in December was actually revealing. My endocrinologist wanted to run baseline labs. What I noticed: meticulously tracking calories without the one cheat day, my weight dropped faster off TRT. But my levels went near zero. The tests confirmed the original diagnosis — primary hypogonadism from the physical damage — and I went back on. I'm on TRT for the rest of my life. My levels go to zero without it.\n\n## What I Actually Think About All This\n\nI'm not advising this protocol. I'm not linking to doctors with affiliate codes. I'm not saying this is safe for you, or that your situation is anything like mine.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I watched the Liver King situation, and the thing that bothered me about it wasn't the drugs — it was the lecture. The \"you're subprime\" framing while quietly running a protocol that would make my stack look like a multivitamin. If you're going to post your physique online, you owe people the context.\n\nThe commenter who said they wanted to buy a Speediance to get a physique like mine — I want them to know what they're actually looking at. Years of training history. Multiple rounds of significant weight loss. A hormonal condition that's been actively managed for years. A six-month period of extreme discipline that I specifically structured around a winter when I knew my family life would allow it. And pharmaceutical support that I couldn't have done this without.\n\nThe Speediance is real. The progressive overload tracking, the ease of daily lifting, the volume I can accumulate without setup overhead — all real. The physique required a lot more than a cable machine. Now you know what."

    content: "## Why I Built This\n\nThe problem sounds simple: I have too much data from too many devices that don't talk to each other.\n\nWHOOP 4.0, Garmin Forerunner 265S, 8Sleep Pod, Speediance Gym Monster 2S \u2014 plus calorie tracking through Chronometer. Each device lives in its own app, its own ecosystem, its own walled garden. Speediance doesn't have a web app. Tonal didn't either. WHOOP's web app has gotten progressively worse over the past two years. None of them are designed to talk to each other in any meaningful way.\n\nSo I ended up doing what I always do with data problems: I built something.\n\nAbout a week into running OpenClaw on an M1 Mac Mini I had collecting dust, I had a working fitness intelligence system that pulls from six connectors and generates two reports: a **morning report** that tells me how hard I should train, and a **nightly report** that evaluates how the day went. Both post automatically to a hosted dashboard (GitHub Pages) that I can check from anywhere.\n\n## The Stack\n\n**Hardware:** M1 Mac Mini as the base agent host. I have three OpenClaw instances running \u2014 Arya (handles the fitness dashboard and Kanban board), Bob (assistant/reminders/home automation), and Claude (backup/verification). The fitness system runs on Arya.\n\n**Models:** Primary orchestration through a paid Miniax M2.5 plan ($10/month), which is reliable and slow enough to properly delegate tasks without burning tokens. When I need heavy lifting \u2014 multi-step integration work, debugging, building new connectors \u2014 I switch Arya temporarily to Claude (Anthropic). For routine daily report generation, the $10 plan handles it.\n\n**Connectors (6 active):**\n- WHOOP API (recovery score, HRV, sleep data, strain)\n- Garmin Connect (activity data \u2014 runs, HR zones, pace, training load)\n- Speediance (via the unofficial API endpoint from the Reddit community \u2014 it pulls completed workout data including volume, exercise breakdown, and 1RM estimates)\n- 8Sleep (sleep score, temperature, HRV from the Pod)\n- Chronometer (calorie and macro data)\n- Apple Health (bridge layer that lets Speediance calorie data reach WHOOP for accurate strain calculation)\n\nThe Speediance connector is the one people ask about most. There's no official API. Someone in the Reddit community published the endpoint that returns your completed workout data. OpenClaw found it, I pointed it at the URL, and within minutes it was pulling down my workout history and piping it into the dashboard. The whole workflow \u2014 download the unofficial Speediance manager, decompile it, identify the data endpoint, build a connector \u2014 took the agent less time than it would have taken me to do it manually.\n\n## What the Morning Report Actually Looks Like\n\nHere's the real output from **February 11, 2026** \u2014 the 18% WHOOP recovery day:\n\n---\n\n**MORNING FITNESS REPORT \u2014 February 11, 2026**\n\n*Data sources: WHOOP, Garmin, 8Sleep, Speediance, Chronometer*\n\n**Recovery Summary:**\n- WHOOP Recovery: 18% \ud83d\udd34\n- HRV: 18.7ms (below 7-day baseline)\n- Total Sleep (WHOOP): 3.5h\n- 8Sleep Score: 61/100\n- Previous day WHOOP Strain: 11.6\n\n**Training Load (Last 7 days):**\n- Speediance volume: 94,280 lbs\n- Runs logged: 4 sessions, 8.9 miles\n- Highest intensity session: Feb 8 anaerobic run\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Flags:**\n- Sleep debt detected (>2h below baseline)\n- Caloric intake yesterday: 792 kcal (estimated deficit of ~800 kcal vs. maintenance)\n- Injury risk elevated: acute sleep deprivation + caloric deficit\n\n**Recommendation: Active Recovery**\n*Confidence: 77.8% | Weighted Score: 55.65*\n\nReasoning: HRV is depressed relative to rolling baseline. Sleep debt is the primary driver \u2014 3.5h is clinically insufficient for neuromotor recovery. Caloric deficit compounds recovery suppression. Previous strain of 11.6 was moderate and would normally support a light session, but the combination of all three negative inputs (sleep, calories, HRV) shifts the recommendation to Active Recovery only. A light Zone 1 run of 20\u201330 minutes is acceptable. Speediance Warrior 1 at working weight: not recommended today. BJJ: not recommended (degraded reaction time risk).\n\n---\n\nThat's the actual output. Not a generic \"rest today\" \u2014 a reasoned recommendation with the specific inputs surfaced, the confidence level shown, and the BJJ call made explicitly because the system knows I do jiu-jitsu and that BJJ has a different injury risk profile than a lifting session.\n\nThe 77.8% confidence number matters. When confidence is lower \u2014 say, 55% \u2014 I dig into which signals are conflicting. In this case, the previous day's strain wasn't high enough to independently demand rest, but the three other negative signals outvoted it. The model shows its work.\n\n## The Nightly Report\n\nThe nightly report runs after I've had time to log the day's activities. It evaluates:\n- Did training match the morning recommendation?\n- What was the actual WHOOP strain accumulated?\n- Speediance volume if a lifting session happened\n- Calorie close-out from Chronometer\n- Any new 1RM PRs from Speediance\n- Run data from Garmin if applicable\n\nIt posts to the same dashboard. Over time, I can look back and see whether I followed the morning recommendations and what the outcome was \u2014 did I override a red day and feel worse two days later? Did I train on a yellow day and post a PR? The dataset builds into something useful.\n\n## What Building It Actually Taught Me\n\nI expected this to take weeks. It took about a week of evenings. Most of that was the initial setup on the Mac Mini and building the first working connector. Once OpenClaw had one connector working, building the next one was faster. Once it had the data, building the visualization layer was faster still.\n\nThe frustrating parts: the free models (Google AI Studio, Nvidia Kimmy K2.5) make major mistakes under complex multi-step workloads. Google's model once deleted its own core configuration files by running a git clean at the wrong scope. Nvidia's is faster when it works and completely silent when it doesn't. For building and debugging, nothing matches Claude with a proper API key \u2014 but that burns tokens fast. The solution I landed on is: Miniax for daily scheduled runs, Claude on demand when I'm actively building something new.\n\nThe Speediance data pipeline required the most patience. The unofficial endpoint isn't documented. The agent had to inspect the network requests from the unofficial Speediance manager app, identify the right endpoint, figure out the auth pattern, and build a connector that handles pagination properly. It did all of that. I watched it work through it in the logs. That moment \u2014 seeing it successfully pull 125 completed workouts with full exercise breakdowns \u2014 was when I understood why people describe this technology as genuinely different from anything that came before.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nI've been doing fitness tech for years. I had a Microsoft Band before Apple Watch existed. I've used every generation of WHOOP. I've owned Tonal. I've owned two Speediances. I've tracked calories through every app that ever existed in the space.\n\nWhat this system does that nothing else has done is put all of that data **in the same room** and let something with actual reasoning capability look at it together. Not a dashboard of disconnected widgets. An agent that can look at my HRV trend, my lifting volume from last week, my caloric intake, and my sleep data simultaneously and make a judgment call that accounts for all of it.\n\nIs it perfect? No. The calorie data pipeline is still messy \u2014 I'm building an Apple Health bridge for Snap Cow data from my recent trip. The Speediance connector occasionally misses a workout if the unofficial API times out. The BJJ strain problem is real: WHOOP can detect that a jiu-jitsu session elevated my heart rate, but it can't assess the neuromotor and grip-fatigue component the way a knowledgeable coach could.\n\nBut on February 11, when it told me 18% recovery, 77.8% confidence, Active Recovery \u2014 it was right. And it told me before I'd even gotten out of bed.\n\nThat's the version of fitness technology I've been trying to build since I first started tracking this stuff. It just took the right platform to make it possible."

    content: "## The Delivery Experience Nobody Warns You About\n\nI received the Speediance 2S yesterday. It's sitting in my living room right now next to the original Speediance because it's meant to go up in my office. I wanted to give you the meat of this review right away.\n\nTwo criteria mattered to me: how loud is this device, and does it feel significantly heavier?\n\nHere's what happened when it arrived: delivered by pallet. The original Speediance came straight into my house on a dolly — much smaller package because it didn't include a bench. The 2S? Pallet delivery. It was dropped off at the other end of my property, and I had to figure out how to get it inside. That meant unboxing it outside and rolling it across my property. Not a dealbreaker, but definitely a shock at 7 AM.\n\n## The Noise Difference Is Massive\n\nThis is the first thing you need to understand: the 2S in standby mode is dead silent. I thought it wasn't actually on because that's not the experience with the original Speediance.\n\nWhen you turn it on, there's a slight noise. But it's quieter than the air purifier in my office. It's about equivalent to a low-to-medium fan setting. When the fan is on medium, I can't hear the 2S at all.\n\nThe original Speediance? Different story. In standby mode, it's loud. During startup, it's loud. It's the power supply fan — sounds exactly like a late 90s era PC. I'm not exaggerating. I had a gaming PC back in the day with the same noise profile.\n\nFor my living room, the original is fine — there's always a TV blaring, kids running around. But for my office? It was unacceptable. That was the reason I couldn't replace the Tonal in my office with the original Speediance.\n\n## The Weight: 260 Feels Like 60 More\n\nI max out the original Speediance on bench at 220 pounds. On Tonal, I never hit 200. The 2S goes to 260.\n\nWhen I loaded 260 on the 2S for the first time, I expected it to feel only slightly heavier than 220. I was wrong. That 260 feels like an additional 60 pounds, not 40. It hit me like a truck.\n\nHere's why: these digital cable machines don't feel the same as free lifting. There's no momentum to carry you through. On the original Speediance, I can do basically unlimited reps until my cardio fails — it doesn't feel heavy. On the 2S at 260, I was genuinely struggling. I could feel it in my quads during deadlifts in a way the original never gave me.\n\nThis device gives me room to grow. I'm 6'0\" and I've been benching around 200-220 for years. With 260 available, I can actually progress on movements that were maxed out before. Deadlifts on this machine actually work my quads. On the original and Tonal, deadlifts were just cardio — I'd rather run outside.\n\n## The Math: Two Speediances Cost Less Than One Tonal\n\nThis is the part that blew my mind. The total cost of owning Tonal over 5 years — device plus membership — is more than buying both Speediance devices and having one in my office and one in my living room.\n\nTonal's total cost of ownership over the life of the device is roughly what you'd pay for two Speediances with both sitting in your house. That's insane math.\n\n## The Small Changes Add Up\n\nThe 2S has a ring clip that the original doesn't include. It makes clicking in much easier — you hit it with the back of your thumb instead of trying to finagle a ring on your finger while gripping a heavy bar.\n\nThe slow-descent mechanism when you hit the button? It has a spring in it so the weight doesn't drop on your head. On the original, I dropped the handle on my head the first time I used it because I didn't understand the mechanism. This new design prevents that.\n\nThe speaker system is different — that's the main addition on the 2 versus the 2S. But you can buy a Bluetooth speaker for $200 and save yourself $2,000.\n\n## Who Should Buy Which\n\nIf you need the extra resistance OR you need a quiet environment, the 2S is the answer. If neither matters to you — if it's going in a loud garage gym — the original is phenomenal and costs half as much.\n\nThe 2S goes in my office. It's quiet enough to do sets once an hour without disturbing work. The original stays downstairs in my living room where noise doesn't matter.\n\nThe 30-day money-back guarantee matters here. This thing bolts to your wall. You will have giant holes in your wall if you return it. But you don't have to decide upfront — you get 30 days to figure out if it's right for your space.\n\nI couldn't be happier with this upgrade."

    content: "## The Modes Explained\n\nSpeediance has four main modes in the automatic weight settings: Gain Muscle, Stamina, Strength, and Custom. Inside Custom, you also have three weight mode options: Standard, Chain, and Eccentric.\n\nHere's what each one actually does.\n\n**Gain Muscle** sets your weight based on 12-rep capability. Your minimum option is one rep away from failure. That's intense.\n\n**Stamina** sets your weight based on 13-rep capability. This gives you more room for warm-up sets because your working weight is further from your true max.\n\n**Strength** is for lower-rep, heavier work.\n\n**Custom** is where you can manually set your weight and rep targets — but there's a gotcha I'll explain below.\n\n## The Custom Mode Trap\n\nHere's what nobody talks about: Custom mode can reset your 1RM values.\n\nSomeone posted online that they set Custom to 10 pounds for bicep curls as a warm-up, then went into a dynamic mode expecting 33 pounds for their working sets. The machine set their working sets to 10 pounds.\n\nWhy? Because when you enter a weight in Custom without the machine having a strength assessment or PR for that movement, it treats that weight as your new PR. Then it calculates all your dynamic weights from that baseline.\n\nThe fix: don't use Custom for warm-ups. Use one of the dynamic modes (Stamina is what I prefer) and set your weight lower than your working weight. The machine will give you a warm-up set below your working weight without resetting your 1RM.\n\n## My Approach: Stamina For Everything\n\nI use Stamina mode exclusively now. Here's my setup:\n\n- Set weight to 20 (or whatever is comfortably above your warm-up but below your working max)\n- Set training to 13 reps\n- This gives me a warm-up set that's challenging but not grueling\n\nThen I add a second movement in the sequence with the actual working weight — say 29 pounds at 14 reps — and save it as a custom workout.\n\nThe machine remembers your settings. If you crank eccentric mode to max (which I do on every exercise), it remembers that too. Once you've used a movement in a particular way, it remembers across all workouts forever.\n\n## Eccentric Mode Is the Secret\n\nEccentric mode adds resistance on the way down. I have mine set to max on every exercise. Why? Because I'm not a strength athlete — I'm doing jiu-jitsu and need full-arm strength through the entire range of motion.\n\nWith eccentric maxed out, I'm going up with maximal force but resisting on the way down. That means I can't lift as much weight in the concentric (up) phase. My working weight drops, but the total tension through the movement increases.\n\nThis is how I've built triceps without doing tricep isolation exercises. The eccentric loading hits everything.\n\n## The Rep Math\n\nHere's how the weight calculation works: when you set a weight and rep target, the machine calculates what percentage of your 1RM that represents. It then uses that to set your working weight.\n\nWhen I did 16 reps at a 15-rep max setting on bicep curls, I expected a new 1RM. It didn't register. Why? Rounding. The machine rounds down for safety. I needed to do 14 reps to get a full pound over my previous max before it would register as a new PR.\n\nThis is different from Tonal, which would auto-adjust and sometimes skip your working sets if you failed a rep. Speediance lets you continue — if you can do the extra rep, it lets you. But it won't give you credit for it in the PR system unless you clear the rounding threshold.\n\n## The Warm-Up Strategy That Actually Works\n\nMy workouts start with multiple warm-up sets. Every set says \"training\" — none say \"warm-up\" — but they're actually assessment sets.\n\nI bang out 3-4 warm-up exercises in sequence, then 3-4 more, then hit my working sets. If I get to the end of the warm-ups and I'm not feeling it, I call the workout right there. Sometimes I've lifted 10,000 pounds before I even reach my real working sets.\n\nThese aren't junk volume. They're helping me assess how my body feels today, relieve muscle tightness, and prepare for the working sets. By the time I reach the heavy work, I know whether I should push or back off.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nDon't touch Custom mode unless you understand the 1RM implications. Use Stamina for everything. Crank eccentric mode to max if you're training for functional strength, not just numbers on a screen.\n\nThe Speediance's programming is more complex than Tonal's, but it's also more flexible. Once you understand how the modes calculate weight, you can build workouts that precisely match your goals."
