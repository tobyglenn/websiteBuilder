## PART 5: CONTENT BRIEF FOR CLAWD (WEBSITE BUILD)

### What Clawd Needs to Build This Site

**Available Data Assets:**
- ✅ 104 video IDs (YouTube) — thumbnails fetchable via `https://img.youtube.com/vi/{VIDEO_ID}/maxresdefault.jpg`
- ✅ Video titles and publish dates
- 🔄 Transcripts (being generated by Clarity — watch for `~/clawd/shared/outgoing/transcripts/`)
- ✅ Category assignments (this document)
- ✅ Hero content tier assignments (this document)
- ✅ Brand brief and tone guide

**Recommended Tech Stack:**
- **Next.js** (static + ISR) — ideal for YouTube-fed content sites
- **Tailwind CSS** — rapid styling, dark mode support for fitness aesthetic
- **YouTube Data API v3** — thumbnails, video metadata, auto-updating latest videos on homepage
- **MDX** — for writing blog-style articles enriched by transcripts
- **Search:** Fuse.js (client-side) or Algolia for video search

**Content Generation Strategy (with transcripts):**
1. For each Tier 1 hero video: generate a full article (1,200–2,000 words) from transcript — SEO-optimized
2. For each category page: generate a 400-word intro + curated video grid
3. For Speediance Hub: generate FAQ section by extracting Q&A moments from transcripts
4. For My Story page: synthesize transformation videos into a cohesive narrative essay
5. For Training page: extract specific protocols (sets, reps, split details) from training videos

**Affiliate / Monetization Integration:**
- Speediance referral link → prominent in Speediance Hub header and video descriptions
- Garmin / Whoop affiliate links → Tech & Gear page
- Future: coaching, digital product (training template), BJJ Buddy beta access

**SEO Priority Pages (build first):**
1. Speediance 2S Review page (high commercial intent)
2. Speediance vs Tonal comparison page
3. "How I Lost 54 Pounds" transformation story
4. Training Split guide
5. Whoop vs Garmin review

**Design Direction:**
- Dark background preferred (serious, gym aesthetic — not bro-culture garish)
- Typography: bold, confident, readable
- Color accent: electric blue or orange (energy without aggression)
- Photography: Toby in action (lifting, rolling), not stock photos
- No excessive animations — this is a resource site, not a brand stunt

**Tone in Copy:**
- Match Toby's voice: direct, slightly irreverent, technically credible
- No filler phrases ("in today's world," "like never before")
- Lead with specifics (242 lbs → 188 lbs; 600,000 lbs lifted; 41,500 lb workouts)

---

## PART 6: CONTENT CALENDAR OPPORTUNITY

Based on video momentum and content gaps, these are natural next pieces for Toby to consider:
