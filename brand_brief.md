# Toby Glenn — Brand Brief

## Who Is Toby Glenn?

Toby Glenn is a self-made fitness transformation story who turned a near-400-lb life crisis into a sustained, systematic pursuit of physical excellence. He dropped from 242 lbs to 188 lbs in six months, trained with a broken ankle, and rebuilt himself through a combination of strength training, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and relentless experimentation with fitness technology. His content is not aspirational in the abstract — it's documented, honest, and grounded in real numbers (41,500 lbs per workout, 600,000+ lbs lifted on a single machine, 238 lbs with a cast on his leg). Toby is a practitioner-creator: he doesn't coach from a distance, he shows up every day and takes you with him.

## What Is Toby's Brand About?

The throughline across everything Toby makes is **no-BS fitness for serious adults who don't have time for nonsense.** He is deeply skeptical of hype — whether it's fitness tracker marketing, overpriced equipment warranties, inflated BJJ belt rankings, or the mythology around famous athletes. He brings an engineer's mentality to fitness: test it, measure it, call out what's broken, and share what actually works. His Speediance content is the clearest expression of this — he has become arguably the most thorough independent reviewer and power-user of Speediance gym equipment on the internet, with detailed breakdowns of firmware updates, mode differences, real-world weight accuracy, and safety edge cases most creators would never think to test. The same critical lens applies to his BJJ commentary: he engages in the real debates (belt mills, match analysis, Greg Doucette vs. BJJ culture) with informed opinions, not hot takes.

There's also a deeply human undercurrent to Toby's content: vulnerability about weight struggles, humor about parenthood and training (lifting with his daughter, tying his pants mid-roll), and an implicit message that transformation is available to anyone willing to be honest with themselves and put in structured effort. He is not selling a product or a lifestyle aesthetic — he is showing what sustained discipline looks like from the inside, warts and all.

## Tone & Voice

- **Direct.** Never hedges to stay likeable.
- **Funny without trying too hard.** The humor comes from situations (tying pants mid-roll, daughter on the Speediance).
- **Self-aware about transformation.** Not preachy. Doesn't pretend the journey was easy or clean.
- **Technically credible.** Will get into firmware changelogs if that's what it takes to tell the truth.
- **Community-minded.** Engages with the discourse (Jocko, Greg Doucette, Mike Israetel) rather than avoiding controversy.
